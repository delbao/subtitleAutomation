00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,085
Previously on <i>Bunheads</i>...

2
00:00:01,105 --> 00:00:02,783
Your father has a special someone.

3
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:04,380
We gotta make money off this place.

4
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:06,017
- By doing what?
- What about...

5
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,081
A theater?

6
00:00:07,163 --> 00:00:08,269
The closet door opened.

7
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:09,660
He says he's moving to San Jose,

8
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,297
she says she's moving to Encino.

9
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:12,647
I'm supposed to pick where I want to go.

10
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:13,630
We're building an amphitheater.

11
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:15,307
Now this I'm interested in.

12
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,618
- You're interested in?
- Partnering.

13
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,582
- Who gave you flowerpots?
- What are you doing here?

14
00:00:18,664 --> 00:00:20,997
This is my brother Scotty.
Scotty, this is Godot.

15
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,143
Well hello, young man.

16
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:23,780
Sasha's awol too by the way.

17
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:24,927
Well, I know where she is.

18
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:26,195
Apartment hunting. And she found one.

19
00:00:27,342 --> 00:00:28,242
All right, ladies.

20
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:30,165
Keep it light, watch your spacing.

21
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:31,434
Dance as one.

22
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:34,176
<i>( Piano playing )</i>

23
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:35,486
I'm thinking of getting bangs.

24
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:36,672
Oh yeah?

25
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:38,024
Something different. What do you think?

26
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,070
You need a change?

27
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:41,052
Well, yeah.

28
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:42,362
Your life is boring?

29
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:44,163
Ginny... - your friends are boring?

30
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:45,636
Oh boy.

31
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:47,846
New life, new friends,

32
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:49,116
new bangs.

33
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:51,899
Moving the feet, not the mouths, ladies.

34
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,945
Ginny please, get over this Cozette thing.

35
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:55,582
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about Roller Derby,

36
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:56,810
but I didn't tell anyone.

37
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,652
Not my parents or my brother.

38
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:00,084
Your brother?

39
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,622
- I just mean...
- You didn't tell Charlie?

40
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:03,686
But you're so close with him.

41
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:05,897
You tell Charlie everything.

42
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:11,094
- I was just...
- I didn't know you didn't tell Charlie.

43
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:12,814
If you didn't tell Charlie,

44
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:16,006
then clearly, I'm overreacting.

45
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:17,684
Aren't I?

46
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:19,402
Aren't I overreacting?

47
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:21,449
- Uh...
- There's no good answer, Boo.

48
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:24,519
Say your best friend
suddenly had a secret life

49
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,992
that you didn't know about.

50
00:01:26,115 --> 00:01:28,797
When you found out, would
you feel mad, betrayed?

51
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,488
Like maybe your best friend wasn't actually

52
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:31,522
your best friend at all?

53
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:33,090
- Well...
- Or...

54
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:35,731
once you found out she didn't
tell her brother either,

55
00:01:35,854 --> 00:01:37,588
would you feel fine
and forget it ever happened?

56
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,868
- I missed you.
- What?

57
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:41,220
Fanny: <i>A closed mouth is a pretty mouth.</i>

58
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,118
- Sorry.
- Whatever.

59
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,594
I talked to her twice.
It's not like we're best friends.

60
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:46,956
- She named you.
- Come on.

61
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:48,607
Cleo-smacktra? How many seconds of thought

62
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:49,721
did she put into that one?

63
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:51,166
Are you guys fighting again?

64
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:52,486
I don't know. I am the last one

65
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:53,931
to know anything in this relationship.

66
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:57,851
Unbelievable.
I turn my back for five minutes.

67
00:01:57,975 --> 00:02:00,163
Cozette just happened to be
at the rink when I was there.

68
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,483
It's not like I called her up and said

69
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:03,134
"I'll tell you all my secrets, Cozette."

70
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,742
I don't want to hear the C-word anymore.

71
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:06,435
Of course, right to Cozette.

72
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:07,673
That's the choreography.

73
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:09,612
She probably cast some kind
of spell on madame Fanny

74
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:11,181
to make it happen like that.

75
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,698
Cozette can do anything.
Cozette's a wizard.

76
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,638
I thought you didn't
want to hear the C-word?

77
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,330
I'm sorry about Ginny.

78
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,979
I love her, but she's stubborn.

79
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,590
Just give her time.

80
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:21,829
You didn't do anything wrong.

81
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:23,272
Who's Ginny?

82
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:24,923
She's magic and perfect,

83
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:27,523
and worldly, and so so hip.

84
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,463
She's Carnaby Street in pointe shoes.

85
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:31,815
When did we even meet Cozette?

86
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:32,971
I'm Cozette.

<i>( Piano song ends )</i>

88
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,412
What a wonderful first try.

89
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,218
<i>It reminds me of a time</i>
<i>when I was a young soloist</i>

90

<i>in "Les Sylphides"</i>

91
00:02:47,703 --> 00:02:49,066
and I was having a terrible fight

92
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,303
with a nymph...

93
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:52,449
or a nympho, which is
a more accurate description

94
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:54,430
and the actual reason for our fight.

95
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:57,691
Anyhow we wound up having
words during rehearsal.

96
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:59,548
And do you know what happened?

97
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,551
We both watched opening night from
the concession stand in the lobby.

98
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:07,318
So with that in mind...

You've got to be kidding.

00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:26,725
Could you guys open up another register?

108
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,093
Come on.

109
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:31,037
And that's the stage

110
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:32,861

111
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:35,059
Oh, and we're going to hang lanterns

113
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,625

Pretty. No, not you, Saul.

00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:42,150
Why would I call you pretty?

116
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,393
I hope the stage is big enough.

117
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:44,720
Do you think the stage is big enough?

118
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:46,462
For the halftime show, or?

119
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:47,581
You're right. You're right. It's fine.

120
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:49,033
Whoa, hey. If you need a bigger stage,

121
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:50,318
let's make a bigger stage.

122
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:51,521
They're two weeks late on rent.

123
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:53,387
Go find someone that
speaks Lithuanian deadbeat

124
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:54,423
and tell them to get out.

125
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:56,041
- I am so excited.
- I know.

126
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:57,409
I'm wearing that shirt you hate

127
00:04:57,492 --> 00:04:58,487
and you haven't asked me
what bum I had to roll

128
00:04:58,529 --> 00:04:59,855
to get it yet.

129
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:01,265
What do you girls think of the stage?

130
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:02,426
It's really cool.

131
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,002
I've never danced outside before.

132
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:05,578
If the stage is gonna be bigger,

133
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:07,485
we have to tell Fat Bob and Skinny Don.

134
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,724
Fanny: <i>And I swore to them that</i>
<i>we'd finalized everything.</i>

135
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,466
This will not make them happy.

136
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:13,705
Ladies, we are not
here to make them happy.

137
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:15,239
This is for us and the kids.

138
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:17,562
Hey! Fat Bob and Skinny Don.

139
00:05:17,644 --> 00:05:19,012
Oh, we don't usually
call them that to their face.

140
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:21,169
- Is something wrong?
- We want to make the stage bigger.

141
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:22,289
They want to make the stage bigger.

142
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:23,283
We already ordered the wood.

143
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,320
Last week.

144
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:25,647
Made the call, wrote the check.

145
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,766
Well, can you order more,

146
00:05:26,808 --> 00:05:28,425
or is that the last wood in the world?

147
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:30,291
Uh, yeah, the sarcasm
has not gone unnoticed.

148
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:32,655
But see, now, there's
gonna be some lag time.

149
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,272
- Two, three...
- Four, five...

150
00:05:34,397 --> 00:05:35,391
- Weeks.
- Months.

151
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:36,760
- Months?
- Come on.

152
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:38,790
Give me the bottom line here,
fat Bob and skinny don.

153
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:39,805
Oh, jeez, well...

154
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,226
Save it for Spielberg, Olivier.

155
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,484
- Give me the number.
- 10.

156
00:05:42,565 --> 00:05:43,336
- 10?
- Done.

157
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,716
And you know, a bigger stage

158
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,769
is gonna need more lights.

159
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,233
- Fine.
- That means two...

160
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,613
- Three...
- Four extra banks.

161
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:50,438
- Do it.
- Wait, Milly,

162
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:52,184
that's too much.
We don't need more lights.

163
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:53,402
Yeah, we'll just shove the ugly kids

164
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:54,457
in the dark spots.

165
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:55,878
More lights will make it beautiful.

166
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,135
It has to be beautiful.

167
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,962
Everything is beautiful at the ballet.

168
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:00,099
You done fleecing me yet?

169
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,168
- Probably not.
- Go build something.

170
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:03,670
Well, if we're getting noise complaints

171
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,212
tell them they can't run
their heart-lung machine

172
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:06,186
between 10:00 and 6:00.

173
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:07,566
Michelle, I have to say

174
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:09,515
it was a stroke of genius getting Milly

175
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:10,569
involved with this.

176
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:11,909
Wow, thanks.

177
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,978
And that shirt makes you
look like a freeway underpass.

178
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:15,926
Milly: Tell me again the
total profit after expenses.

179
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:18,321
( Laughing )
Tell me again.

180
00:06:18,443 --> 00:06:19,620
I love money.

181
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:22,785
Let me just get you those checks

182
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,206
and I'll get out of your hair.

183
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:25,667
Is there anything else we need?

184
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:28,142
Oh, no. You've been an
absolute godsend, Milly.

185
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:29,563
Really. Everything you've done has been

186
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:30,822
just about perfect.

187
00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:31,998
Just about?

188
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,541
What do you mean "just about?"

189
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:35,489
No. Absolutely perfect.

190
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:38,046
The costumes the parents are
making are going to be lovely.

191
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:40,116
We won't even miss the
professionally made ones.

192
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:41,171
Shouldn't we have those?

193
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,997
Well, in a perfect world.

194
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,255
I live in a perfect world.

195
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:45,473
I think we'll be fine.

196
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:47,503
Look, if I spend all
this money on a theater

197
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:48,882
and then the dancers show up looking like

198
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:50,303
a bus and truck tour of "Oliver,"

199
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,129
I might as well be investing
in public television.

200
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:54,036
- Order the costumes.
- Are you sure?

201
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:55,335
I am positive.

202
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,502
You won't be sorry.

203
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:58,674
These beautiful costumes will put those

204
00:06:58,714 --> 00:07:00,765
secondhand usher outfits to shame.

205
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:01,770
So evil.

206
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:03,298
Ushers. Do we have those?

207
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:05,670
Oh, you're right. We don't need them.

208
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:07,601
Smart. You see, Michelle?

209
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:09,692
This is what you have
a business partner for.

210
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,582
To tell you exactly
where to cut the costs.

211
00:07:11,702 --> 00:07:12,466
No ushers.

212
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:13,794
Wait, I want ushers.

213
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,523
- Well, maybe next year.
- This year.

214
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:16,608
Let's give it six months.

215
00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:18,137
Now, I want them now. How many?

216
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:20,187
- 10?
- 20.

217
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:21,675
20 ushers, all boys.

218
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:22,922
Tall, built, find them.

219
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:24,529
<i>( Cellphone rings )</i>

220
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,098
Stone here.

221
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,310
Father Luke, thanks for calling me back.

222
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,200
I understand your religious tradition

223
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:31,969
calls for hanging a lot of paraphernalia,

224
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,296
but it's destroying my walls.

225
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:34,945
I mean, it's three nails
for every crucifix.

226
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:36,794
You're killing me.

227
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:37,679
- We good?
- We're perfect.

228
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,408
And evil.

229
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:41,540
Good-bye, Milly.

230
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,233
Costumes, usher uniforms,

231
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:45,279
ushers.

232
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,445
We need all those things.

233
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:47,450
I'm just wondering,

234
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,099
are you putting out for all of this?

235
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,104
'Cause there's definitely some sort of

236
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:51,874
quid pro quo going on here.

237
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:53,362
Don't be vulgar.

238
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:54,930
I'm doing it for the art.

239
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,136
And for the children.

240
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:57,303
Hey, I'm not judging.

241
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:58,629
As long as the lady's paying for it,

242
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,439
why not take the vicuna?

243
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:03,897
All right, let's begin.

244
00:08:03,977 --> 00:08:05,515
First position, plies.

245
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,192
- Raincoat?
- Bring it!

246
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:09,453
- Bikini?
- Bring it.

247
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,588
- Pajama jeans?
- Bring them.

248
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,495
- Handcuffs?
- Toss them in.

249
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,928
Hard hat, waffle iron, Bananarama box set?

250
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:16,185
What the hell are we
gonna do with a waffle iron?

251
00:08:16,348 --> 00:08:18,254
Scotty, come on.
Tell me what this thing is.

252
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:19,471
Hey, it's my last night.

253
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:21,094
And the rules are
whoever has the last night

254
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:23,324
gets to choose the last
night blowout activity.

255
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,514
- Don't flout the rules.
- But I need details.

256
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:26,812
I told you, it's in the desert.

257
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:28,962
- It's like Burning Man.
- Which means nothing.

258
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:30,868
- You've heard of Burning Man.
- Yes, I've heard of Burning Man,

259
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,166
but since I've never been to Burning Man,

260
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:33,707
I can only guess what takes place.

261
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:34,802
Like do they really burn a man?

262
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:36,303
And who is this man? Is he annoying,

263
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:38,088
- does he have it coming?
- You'll just have to find out.

264
00:08:38,128 --> 00:08:39,385
Okay, well at least answer me this.

265
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,008
When we get there,
will there be a bathroom?

266
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,266
Define bathroom.

267
00:08:42,306 --> 00:08:44,252
( Sighs )
Nice seein' ya.

268
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:45,226
Call me when you get home.

269
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:46,524
Oh, come on. Did I complain

270
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:48,146
when you visited me and made me go see

271
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,445
Drag Queen Bingo?

272
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:50,620
Vehemently.

273
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:52,081
'Cause it was horrible and I lost.

274
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:53,378
Yeah, that was fun.

275
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:54,677
Well, come on, this will be fun too.

276
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:56,258
Come on, it'll be like all those
cool road trips

277
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:57,311
we took as kids.

278
00:08:57,312 --> 00:08:58,529
What cool road trips?

279
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:01,734
What do you mean?
The Grand Canyon, New Orleans, Sun Studios,

280
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:02,869
The Smoky Mountains.

281
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:05,667
- Fake.
- The Smoky Mountains are fake?

282
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:06,763
The trips were fake.

283
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,224
What are you talking about??

284
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:09,805
Mom used to take us on fake trips.

285
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,671
- You didn't know that?
- No.

286
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:13,292
She'd put us in the car
really late at night

287
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:14,550
and then drive us around for hours

288
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:16,376
until we fell asleep.
And then when we woke up,

289
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,971
she'd convince us that we just
had a really fun adventure.

290
00:09:19,053 --> 00:09:20,108
No. That's impossible.

291
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:22,217
I remember that thing with the balloons.

292
00:09:22,338 --> 00:09:23,636
- Never happened.
- Yes.

293
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:25,583
There were like these huge red balloons

294
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:26,962
with ribbons hanging down.

295
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:28,908
- I'm afraid not.
- The wind kicked up

296
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:31,180
and we held the ribbons
and we rode on them?

297
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:35,966
- No balloons?
- She gaslighted us, dude.

298
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:37,994
That was my second favorite
childhood memory.

299
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:42,253
Don Mclean didn't play
your fifth birthday party.

300
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:46,431
I'll give you some space.

301
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,921
I just moved in so I need
to get the power turned on.

302
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,784
By tomorrow would be great actually.

303
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:59,931
A credit card? Well, I do.

304
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,186
I mean, it's technically my parents',

305
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,967
but they take it at the mall, so...

306
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,154
Can we just skip the deposit?

307
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:06,692
I'm very responsible.

308
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:08,677
It's true. She's never
been drunk or pregnant.

309
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:10,862
Look, can I just give you cash?

310
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:13,172
Oh. I don't think the atm

311
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:14,549
will give me that much.

312
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,452
Really?

313
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,679
Wow, I've never actually
gone inside a bank before.

314
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,040
Yes. It will be an adventure.

315
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,173
Thank you.

316
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:25,685
Anyone know where a bank is?

317
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:28,236
That is a very long to-do list.

318
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,989
Cable, phone, Internet, electricity...

319
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,244
- What about gas?
- What about it?

320
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,945
<i>Is your water heater electric or gas?</i>

321
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:35,565
- I have no idea.
- It's probably gas.

322
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:36,699
Calling the gas company.

323
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:38,359
This is a lot of work.

324
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,060
But it's worth it.
The apartment is awesome.

325
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,477
I mean, it needed a little <i>jeuje.</i>

326
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:43,097
A paint job, new sink,

327
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:44,311
I'm pulling up the carpets.

328
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,296
People who cover up their hardwood floors

329
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:49,090
deserve their own poorly
decorated section of hell.

330
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:50,548
Wow, you seem so grown up.

331
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:52,411
Hey, did I leave my dance
bag in your mom's car?

332
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:55,083
I don't know. You know who would know?

333
00:10:55,164 --> 00:10:56,987
- How would she know?
- She knows everything about you.

334
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:58,647
I figure she can use
her Melanie Lojack system

335
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:00,104
and track that sucker right down.

336
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,320
Oh, here. For you,

337
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,898
and you, and you.

338
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,437
- What's this?
- I am officially inviting you

339
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,895
to my housewarming party.

340
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:07,555
Sorry it's so last minute,
but I thought heat and light

341
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:08,649
would make it more festive.

342
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,944
Would it be okay if I bring Carl?

343
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:11,443
No. No one brings anyone.

344
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,022
It's just the four of us.

345
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,371
Yes, and all the other
people I'm inviting.

346
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:16,747
Who? Who are you inviting?

347
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:18,651
Well, freak, some girls from class,

348
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:20,352
Michelle, the three people
I like at school,

349
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:22,134
and my neighbors so they can't
complain about the noise.

350
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:24,968
( Laughing )

351
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,668
Are you inviting Cozette?

352
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:27,811
Well, she's in our class.

353
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:29,405
- If she comes, count me out.
- Seriously?

354
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:30,589
- Ginny, come on.
- What come on?

355
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,896
Four's company. Five's a crowd.

356
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,407
Fine. If Ginny's not going, I'm not going.

357
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:35,082
- You don't have to do that.
- I want to.

358
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:36,264
It's not on my account, I hope.

359
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:37,449
Of course it's on your account.

360
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,431
- Then go. Yes.
- No.

361
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:40,269
Oh my God.

362
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:45,007
We haven't been properly introduced.
I'm Sasha.

363
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:46,192
I was planning on inviting you

364
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:47,376
to a housewarming party I'm having

365
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,642
so we can get to know each other,

366
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:49,990
but my friends over there are re-enacting

367
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,175
the last third of "Benjamin Button"

368
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:52,603
and will soon turn four.

369
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:53,870
So would it be okay if we just grabbed

370
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,341
a coffee sometime instead?

371
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:57,505
- Cool beans.
- I'm interpreting that as a yes.

372
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:58,649
So, thank you.

373
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:03,346
No Cozette. Okay?

374
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:05,307
Kim, Khloe?

375
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:06,981
Truce for the evening?

376
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:08,043
Good.

377
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:13,638
So, do I get to bring Carl?

378
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:16,538
It's an annual event in the desert

379
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:18,662
that is a celebration of self-expression.

380
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:20,378
Yeah, but what does it
say about bathrooms?

381
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,910
Oh, look at these pictures.
My God, it's beautiful.

382
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,544
Yeah yeah yeah.
Is there a picture of the bathrooms?

383
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:26,546
"An experiment in communal living."

384
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:28,996
I've done that before.
You wind up never having a clean towel.

385
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:30,466
Ooh, what's that over there?

386
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,427
- A rock.
- Oh, I thought it was a bathroom.

387
00:12:32,508 --> 00:12:35,367
Are you planning on eating
a great deal of roadside food

388
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:37,655
and having some terrible
reaction once you get there?

389
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:39,044
I just have a thing about bathrooms, okay?

390
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,576
I want one within a good 10-mile radius.

391
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:43,863
You're an artist.
You need to be open to new things.

392
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:45,416
That's how I felt about Woodstock.

393
00:12:45,538 --> 00:12:46,886
You went to Woodstock?

394
00:12:47,008 --> 00:12:48,316
I didn't want to at first.

395
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,909
But it turned out to be one of the best

396
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,379
experiences of my life.

397
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:53,584
Because I gave myself over to it.

398
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:57,179
All I remember is this
warm gooey haze of a weekend

399
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:59,179
filled with love and connection.

400
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,731
And at the end of it,

401
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:02,365
I wound up with a baby.

402
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,032
Hubbell was conceived at Woodstock?

403
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:06,714
No, literally.
I opened my bag as I was leaving

404
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:08,339
and somebody had slipped a baby inside.

405
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:09,599
Oh my God. What'd you do?

406
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,550
I just left it at the lost baby table

407
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,173
in the parking lot.
A lot of babies were put

408
00:13:13,174 --> 00:13:14,476
in the wrong purse that day.

409
00:13:14,517 --> 00:13:16,102
Woodstock, huh?

410
00:13:16,305 --> 00:13:17,605
- Mm.
- What's the bathroom situation there?

411
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:20,368
( Sighs )
<i>( Cellphone rings )</i>

412
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:21,953
- Hello?
- <i>Check your mailbox.</i>

413
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:23,985
- Is it ticking?
- <i>I put something in it for you.</i>

414
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:26,220
- Sasha?
- <i>Yes, just make sure you go and check</i>

415
00:13:26,342 --> 00:13:27,806
<i>your mailbox because sometimes you don't.</i>

416
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:29,187
Why do you know about my mailbox?

417
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:30,364
<i>Because sometimes we walk by</i>

418
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:31,747
<i>and all the mail is spilling out</i>

419
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,804
<i>like you haven't checked it in forever,</i>

420
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:33,738
<i>and we wonder if you're dead,</i>

421
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:34,673
<i>but no one wants to look.</i>

422
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:36,055
Hey, what if I need help?

423
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:37,965
<i>If you're dead, it's too late for help.</i>

424
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:40,525
Good point. Wait a minute,
rehearsal's in five minutes.

425
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:41,988
- <i>So?</i>
<i>- Aren't you here?</i>

426
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:45,686
- Really?
- What?

427
00:13:45,848 --> 00:13:47,108
So you had to call? You were gonna see me

428
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,611
- in three seconds.
- I wanted to invite you

429
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:49,709
to my housewarming party.

430
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,171
But you already sent me an invitation.

431
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:52,716
Yes, but you never check your mail,

432
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,058
so who knows if you'd find it.

433
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,252
You're calling to tell me to check my mail

434
00:13:56,374 --> 00:13:57,836
to find it, so chances are I'll find it.

435
00:13:57,918 --> 00:14:00,315
Remember when we hid that bunch of
rotting bananas in your dance bag?

436
00:14:00,478 --> 00:14:01,900
You did? That's the smell?

437
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:03,364
Check your box.

438
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:06,939
I found pictures.

439
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:08,240
Gah, must unsee.

440
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:09,540
"Eternal Sunshine" my mind.

441
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:11,369
You lived in Vegas.
How can this be shocking?

442
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:12,832
Okay, if that happened in Vegas,

443
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:14,864
even Vegas would be saying,
"tell someone about this."

444
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:16,083
"Don't let it stay in Vegas."

445
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,140
Hey, partners.

446
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:18,846
Fanny: <i>Milly, what a nice surprise.</i>

447
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:20,106
I just came by to drop off

448
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:21,284
a couple more checks.

449
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,601
Who knew usher uniforms
could be so expensive?

450
00:14:23,723 --> 00:14:25,349
- Really?
- What, are they made of vicuna or something?

451
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,649
I don't know what they're made of,

452
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,505
but at those prices, I'm gonna start

453
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:28,647
selling them myself.

454
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:30,156
Just know how grateful we are to you

455
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,624
for your patronage.

456
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,745
All right, everyone, finish warming up.

457
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:35,213
Rehearsal in five minutes.

458
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:36,681
Um, Fanny, I was wondering

459
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:39,169
- if this might be a good time.
- For what?

460
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,432
Well, for my backer's rehearsal.

461
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,021
- Your what?
- My backer's rehearsal.

462
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:46,346
It's a special advance
performance for investors.

463
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:47,650
Yeah, we know what
a backer's rehearsal is.

464
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:48,997
- So you read "Playbill"?
- What?

465
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:50,506
"Playbill." I started reading it

466
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:52,381
the minute I became a player
in the biz, so to speak,

467
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:53,727
and now I'm totally addicted.

468
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,011
Did you know the lead in
"Memphis" just booked a sitcom?

469
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:57,398
- We did not know that.
- It's true.

470
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,069
So is now a good time?

471
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,027
It seems like you're about ready
to rehearse now anyhow, so...

472
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:03,066
Milly, this would absolutely not...

473
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:04,330
Fanny, can I...

474
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:05,513
Over here for a sec.

475
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,060
Is she out of her mind?

476
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,896
Isn't it enough I let her put
her name on the amphitheater?

477
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:12,772
Excuse me, on the performance center?

478
00:15:12,935 --> 00:15:14,240
Pretend to be looking at our schedule.

479
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:16,279
A performance center isn't a theater.

480
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:17,747
It's where Michael Phelps goes to train.

481
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:19,175
- I know.
- It's where they test

482
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:21,458
- expensive German sports cars.
- Don't disagree.

483
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:24,150
It's where men with defective
equipment have pumps installed

484
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:26,393
so that they can leave their
wives for a yoga teacher.

485
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:28,595
Okay, come back to me here.

486
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:29,981
This is an invasion.

487
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:31,490
She can see the show when it's ready.

488
00:15:31,572 --> 00:15:33,894
- Just like everyone else.
- Okay, devil's advocate.

489
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:35,487
If it weren't for Milly,
we wouldn't have a theater,

490
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,994
or lights, or costumes.

491
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:39,034
<i>And let's not forget</i>
<i>the well-built ushers.</i>

492
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,196
That's definitely a perk.

493
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:42,461
She just wants to see a rehearsal

494
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,091
and we're already doing a rehearsal.

495
00:15:44,213 --> 00:15:45,723
Letting her watch a little pretty dancing

496
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:47,476
seems like a small price to pay.

497
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:52,003
Well...

498
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:53,838
We have some good news.

499
00:15:53,878 --> 00:15:55,184
We checked our schedule,

500
00:15:55,428 --> 00:15:57,467
and it looks like we can do
your backer's rehearsal

501
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:58,977
- right now.
- Really?

502
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,403
- Really.
- Great.

503
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,809
- There's just one small problem.
- What?

504
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:04,278
Well, backer's rehearsals

505
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,521
usually have beautiful spreads of food.

506
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:08,274
Sushi platters, champagne,

507
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:10,109
one time I saw a crepe guy.

508
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:13,087
It's just a shame that
this is on such short notice.

509
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:15,941
- We couldn't arrange that.
- Let me make a call.

510
00:16:18,755 --> 00:16:22,811
At least we're gonna eat.

511
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:27,103
Hey.

512
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:28,612
What are you doing here?

513
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:29,510
I don't suppose you'd believe

514
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,733
I'm signing up for class?

515
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:32,160
Channeling my inner Baryshnikov?

516
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,302
No.

517
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:34,730
Then I guess I was hoping

518
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:35,830
I'd run into you.

519
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,421
I haven't seen you around lately.

520
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:38,401
Oh, yeah.

521
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:40,032
- Things have been crazy.
- I figured.

522
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:42,680
I mean, none of your texts are
more than three letters long.

523
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:44,722
- Sorry.
- I can't even figure out half of them.

524
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,190
What does "CTN" mean?

525
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:48,271
- Can't text now.
- Oh, of course.

526
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:50,024
Or can't talk now depending on context.

527
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:51,574
I think you've sent both.

528
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:54,021
I'm really sorry.
I've just been crazy with stuff, you know?

529
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,182
Well, are you busy tonight?

530
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:57,243
- I was thinking...
- I can't tonight.

531
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:58,630
- I'm...
- Yeah.

532
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,791
- Okay.
- But we'll do something soon.

533
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:02,056
I promise.

534
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:04,054
I'll text you. Four letters this time.

535
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:09,764
So Milly, we'll be getting started

536
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:11,109
in just a second.

537
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:12,782
- It's very exciting.
- Oh, I know.

538
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:14,454
- For everyone.
- And you'll be happy to know

539
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:15,961
I unwrapped my hard candy,

540
00:17:15,962 --> 00:17:17,146
so the noise won't be distracting

541
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:18,165
during the performance.

542
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,715
I'm thrilled.

543
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:23,263
Okay, class. We have a special
guest for rehearsal today.

544
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:26,527
Our benevolent benefactor, our angel,

545
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,565
Millicent Stone.

546
00:17:28,566 --> 00:17:30,565
( Applause )

547
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:35,703
Please, call me Milly
and pretend I'm not here.

548
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,743
Places, everyone.

549
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:40,842
We'll just run the opening,
Ray-Ray's solo,

550
00:17:41,005 --> 00:17:42,187
and then the ending.

551
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:43,737
Those need the most work anyhow.

552
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:45,489
Sounds...
<i>( Screeching, scraping )</i>

553
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:51,312
What is she doing?

554
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:53,674
A very poorly staged
version of "Mein Herr"?

555
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,276
( Scraping continues )

556
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:20,716
And music, please.

557
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:22,915
<i>( "Sleeping Beauty Waltz" playing )</i>

558
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:55,739
She's not...

559
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,570
No...

560
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,562
She's taking notes.

561
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,277
- I'm gonna...
- No, you're not.

562
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,267
( Inhales )
It's okay.

563
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:47,376
( Breathes deeply )

564
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:28,915
( Applause )

565
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:30,911
Wonderful work, everyone.

566
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:32,581
Very very nice.

567
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:35,065
Now remember, we tech next Wednesday

568
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:36,897
and dress on Thursday.

569
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:38,607
I'll see you all then.

570
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:41,499
Dancers to the chair, please.

571
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:42,599
What the hell is she talking about?

572
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,716
Let's go. Time is money.

573
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,997
<i>( Cellphone rings )</i>

574
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:49,115
Yes?

575
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:51,109
Can't now. Have a note session.

576
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:53,879
<i>Okay, so a lot of good stuff here.</i>

577
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,671
Just a few things.

578
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:58,807
First off, it's very confusing
that you're not wearing tutus.

579
00:20:58,888 --> 00:21:00,720
People expect tutus
when you go to the ballet.

580
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,431
- Milly!
- Back it up, back it up.

581
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,200
Milly, it wasn't a dress rehearsal.

582
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:09,110
They weren't in costume

583
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:11,594
because it was not a dress rehearsal.

584
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:15,341
So they weren't dressed.

585
00:21:17,662 --> 00:21:19,984
I promise there will be
tutus for the show.

586
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:21,856
Oh. Oh, good. So we're on the same page.

587
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:24,218
Great. So thank you
for your helpful thoughts...

588
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,359
Hold on.

589
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:27,680
There's too much of this step...

590
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,304
You get the gist. So less of that

591
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:32,445
for the whole group.

592
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:34,970
And don't do the spinny thing.

593
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,803
It makes me dizzy.

594
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:39,165
And you, you did this one move

595
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:41,120
where it looked like you were tripping.

596
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,259
That was when I tripped.

597
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:43,643
Good catch, Milly.

598
00:21:43,644 --> 00:21:46,332
You're absolutely right.
The tripping should change.

599
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:48,328
- Right, Fanny?
- Sure.

600
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,812
And here's a question.
Where are the dwarves?

601
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,237
Dwarves?

602
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:53,674
We're doing "Sleeping Beauty."
There are supposed

603
00:21:53,756 --> 00:21:56,508
- to be dwarves.
- In "Snow White."

604
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:59,014
The dwarves are in "Snow White."

605
00:21:59,097 --> 00:22:02,136
We are not doing "Sleeping
Beauty And The Seven Dwarves."

606
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:03,944
Oh, I always get those mixed up.

607
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,450
Okay, next.

608
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:07,929
What's with all the mirrors?

609
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:09,490
Who needs to look at themselves that much?

610
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,215
All right. That's it. We're done.

611
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:12,859
Wait, I have more pages.

612
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:14,173
You wanted to see a rehearsal,

613
00:22:14,214 --> 00:22:15,283
you saw it, we're done.

614
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:16,762
Look, Fanny,

615
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:18,815
"Playbill" says a producer
gets to give notes.

616
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:20,500
You are not a producer.

617
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:22,020
I gave money.

618
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:24,031
A producer is someone who gives money.

619
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:26,004
And a producer gets to have an opinion

620
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,319
and give notes,

621
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:29,579
and they usually have
a chair with their name on it

622
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,756
which I have ordered, and it
should be here by Wednesday.

623
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:34,139
And that is what is wrong
with the arts today.

624
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:36,152
People with no knowledge at all

625
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:39,028
throw a wad of cash on the table
like a drug dealer

626
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:40,630
and then everybody listens.

627
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:42,314
Well, not me and not here.

628
00:22:42,396 --> 00:22:43,956
You are not Scott Rudin

629
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:45,970
and this is not a Johnny Depp movie.

630
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:48,271
This is my studio and my production

631
00:22:48,353 --> 00:22:51,598
and you have absolutely
no right to give notes.

632
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:52,913
And if that's a problem,

633
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:54,844
you can just write a letter to "Playbill"

634
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:57,103
and work it out with them.

635
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:59,198
Why are you all listening to her?

636
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:01,129
You said she was our angel.

637
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,963
Everybody out.

638
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:05,196
Everybody!

639
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:07,374
If you won't let me have my input,

640
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:08,770
then I want my money back.

641
00:23:08,811 --> 00:23:10,578
You know that money's already spent.

642
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,057
I'll sue.

643
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:14,357
Then you'll just be known
as that mean little woman

644
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:16,288
that sued the town ballet school

645
00:23:16,412 --> 00:23:18,383
and crushed all the children's dreams.

646
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:19,903
I don't care. You can talk to

647
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,793
that women's center on Howell
if you don't believe me.

648
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:22,779
They're a dry-cleaners now.

649
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:24,833
Fine! Sue!

650
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:26,641
Calling lawyers now.

651
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:27,708
Call lawyers.

652
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:29,516
Phone: <i>Call lawyers.</i>

653
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,185
Uh, so, that was kind of...

654
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:37,954
I know.

655
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,822
I don't know why we're bringing all this.

656
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:43,169
It's a party. It's what people do.

657
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,554
But the point of chips at a party

658
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:45,937
is to soak up booze.

659
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:47,851
This party's being thrown
by a 16-year-old.

660
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:49,154
That's just it. Sasha's a kid.

661
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:50,497
She won't have gotten enough food

662
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:52,737
and the party will suck and everyone
will call her Mary Richards.

663
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:54,243
Yes, grandma. I'm sure all the kids

664
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:55,993
will be calling her Mary Richards.

665
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:58,681
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, just getting bread for the bruschetta.

666
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:00,757
<i>( Music playing )</i>
<i>( Kids chattering )</i>

667
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,544
This is a 16-year-old's apartment?

668
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,417
Michelle: <i>Or Oz. It could be Oz.</i>

669
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:07,922
- She's got a fireplace.
- And wood.

670
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:09,226
There's wood burning in the fireplace.

671
00:24:09,266 --> 00:24:10,732
I had a fireplace when I lived in Oregon.

672
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:11,668
The rats nested in it.

673
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,582
( Gasps )
Check out the food table.

674
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:14,925
Oh, she's got those metal containers

675
00:24:15,006 --> 00:24:16,432
with the candle thingies under them.

676
00:24:16,595 --> 00:24:18,020
Chafing dishes, she's got chafing dishes.

677
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:19,282
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

678
00:24:19,404 --> 00:24:21,032
Could you please get me a pillow?

679
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:22,131
Sure.

680
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:23,353
But don't take a nice one.

681
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:24,901
Then I'll have to run back to my place.

682
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:25,959
( Gasps )
Let's check out the bathroom.

683
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,018
Does she let people go in there?

684
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:28,442
I'm going in.

685
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:30,397
Okay, now do I add the nuts?

686
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:31,822
Martha says when the egg white

687
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:33,653
has been properly beaten, no clear liquid

688
00:24:33,694 --> 00:24:35,323
should remain at the bottom of the bowl.

689
00:24:35,404 --> 00:24:36,423
I see no clear liquid.

690
00:24:36,545 --> 00:24:38,213
- Then follow Martha.
- Adding the nuts.

691
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,476
Pipes look good.

692
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,900
That adds a lot of resale value.

693
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:42,122
Take your broker's vest off, Ginny.

694
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:43,629
Oh, shoot. I forgot the ice ring

695
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,053
- for the punch.
- Ooh, I'll get it.

696
00:24:48,962 --> 00:24:50,549
It's so pretty.

697
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,463
The pansies are edible.

698
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:54,906
Monogrammed towels.
She has monogrammed towels.

699
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:56,046
- I saw.
- Don't you need, like,

700
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:57,716
six weeks to get something monogrammed?

701
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:59,425
No idea. I write my name on my underpants

702
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:00,691
with a sharpie.

703
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:05,263
Hey, isn't that your cheerleading friend?

704
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:07,182
Sasha: <i>Aubrey. I didn't even invite her.</i>

705
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,978
Cheerleaders can sense parties.

706
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:10,283
It's innate. It's like their ability

707
00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:11,427
to make people feel small.

708
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,142
Sasha!

709
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:14,571
I hope it's okay that I came

710
00:25:14,653 --> 00:25:15,836
'cause when I heard my friend Sasha

711
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:17,592
was having a party, I just had to be here.

712
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:19,593
Of course. Friend.

713
00:25:19,715 --> 00:25:21,144
Oh, hey, Boo, will you stir for me?

714
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:23,103
I'll be right back.

715
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:24,410
Hi, I'm Aubrey.

716
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:25,920
I'm Ginny. We've met before.

717
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:27,186
No.

718
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:28,493
- Several times.
- I don't think so.

719
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:29,799
We're in the same chem class.

720
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,555
- Are you sure?
- We're lab partners.

721
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:33,065
Not ringing any bells.

722
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:34,535
- <i>Hey, Aubrey!</i>
<i>- Maddie, hi!</i>

723
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:35,964
<i>How are you?</i>

724
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:37,637
It's like breathing to them.

725
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:39,188
You made it.

726
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:40,863
- We made it.
- You're the 16-year-old?

727
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:42,006
What's with the hostile tone?

728
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:42,945
I'm a little pissed by all this.

729
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,639
Ignore him. But still, this place.

730
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:47,558
And the furniture, and you have a bucket.

731
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,824
- Of course.
- Not of course.

732
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:50,047
I've never owned a bucket.

733
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,191
I haven't either. You borrow buckets.

734
00:25:51,232 --> 00:25:52,294
- You know what I mean?
- Ignore him.

735
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:53,355
You brought up the bucket.

736
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:54,866
Come on. I want to show you something.

737
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:00,377
Wow. What a great room.

738
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,623
I love the dresser and the pillows.

739
00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:05,480
And how the fresh-cut flowers
pick up the pink in the frog...

740
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:06,948
You've already been in here, haven't you?

741
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:08,705
Totally. Went through your
underwear drawer and everything.

742
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:10,094
Hey, can you show me how to do that thing

743
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:12,135
where you fold up your
socks into tiny little balls?

744
00:26:12,257 --> 00:26:14,095
This is what I wanted you to see.

745
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:16,177
Did you steal it from the studio?

746
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:17,687
No. I had it put in.

747
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:18,831
At Joffrey, there was this girl

748
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,259
who told me her dad
put a barre in her room

749
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,525
so she could practice every night,

750
00:26:21,688 --> 00:26:23,036
and she was really good.

751
00:26:23,158 --> 00:26:25,035
So I figured if I'm gonna get that good,

752
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,055
I need a barre too.

753
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:27,603
Very nice.

754
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:29,844
See? Serious.

755
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:31,028
You are.

756
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,781
Seemed like something you would do.

757
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:37,917
So, hey, do you have your home
invasion escape plan set yet?

758
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,548
- What's that?
- Ah, it's the first thing I do

759
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:41,015
anytime I move in someplace new.

760
00:26:41,096 --> 00:26:42,523
It's a total single girl must.

761
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:43,868
<i>See? I look around a room</i>

762
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,377
and I think the home invader

763
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,967
is coming in through the front door,

764
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,270
so where do I go?

765
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:50,268
You don't want to hide in the closet

766
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,573
<i>'cause he will check the closet</i>

767
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:53,529
and then you're trapped,
so obviously, you're...

768
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:55,526
see ya. Now, you're on the first floor

769
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:56,872
which means you can jump out the window

770
00:26:56,913 --> 00:26:58,462
which is awesome except it also means

771
00:26:58,503 --> 00:27:00,418
the home invader can
come in through the window.

772
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:01,967
Which means you need
a second escape route.

773
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,598
Plus, you hope it's not
a group of home invaders

774
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,555
like in "Taken," so...

775
00:27:07,144 --> 00:27:08,326
And nobody ever attacked me

776
00:27:08,408 --> 00:27:10,119
and I was safe and I got a kitten.

777
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:11,261
Let's see that bucket again.

778
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:12,647
I got the bread.

779
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:14,807
Excuse me a second.
Don't go through my closet.

780
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:16,764
That must mean there's
something good in there.

781
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,965
Well well well, somebody's got a Mini-Me.

782
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:20,188
Stop.

783
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,411
She totally looks up to you.

784
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:23,123
Yeah, 'cause I'm eight feet tall.

785
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:24,469
I think it's cute.

786
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,404
And a little dangerous.

787
00:27:36,128 --> 00:27:37,530
( Laughs )

788
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:41,238
So your vacuum cleaner doesn't need bags?

789
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:42,264
No.

790
00:27:42,468 --> 00:27:43,697
And there's no loss of suction?

791
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:44,965
None that I've noticed.

792
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:46,685
Wow.

793
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:48,118
Here, let me get more ice for you.

794
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:53,479
Hi, I'm Aubrey.

795
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:55,404
- Ginny.
- Good for you.

796
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,328
- What?
- I wish I could be one of those girls

797
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,555
who just doesn't care.

798
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:02,976
When I get an apartment,

799
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:04,326
I'm gonna paint all the walls black

800
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:06,127
and hang silver tinsel from the ceiling.

801
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:07,438
- That's terrifying.
- Not as terrifying

802
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,583
as your fainting couch.

803
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:10,344
Martha said a fainting couch
is the perfect way

804
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:12,595
to create seating without
blocking natural light.

805
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:13,822
She's just jealous.

806
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:15,705
We all are. This place is amazing.

807
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,098
We should totally make it our hangout.

808
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:19,267
Like in that Irish movie
where minnie driver was fat.

809
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:20,535
And they had that clubhouse in the woods

810
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:21,600
where they would all go for parties

811
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:22,869
and secret trysts?

812
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:24,997
Yes, this could be our
secret Irish trysty place.

813
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,471
Done. Hey, stay over tonight.

814
00:28:26,594 --> 00:28:27,535
We'll initiate the clubhouse.

815
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:28,927
- Oh, I can't.
- Me either.

816
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:30,810
- Parents shot the idea down.
- It was your idea.

817
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:32,570
The whole "no adult supervision" thing

818
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:34,575
- is a no go.
- Yeah, it was a big deal.

819
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:35,967
There was oath swearing and everything.

820
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:38,137
Oh. Okay.

821
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:39,567
But we can hang out during the day.

822
00:28:39,568 --> 00:28:41,293
And we'll work out a system eventually.

823
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:43,139
- See you tomorrow?
- Yes. Thanks for coming.

824
00:28:43,385 --> 00:28:45,027
Take leftovers.

825
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:51,837
- Hey.
- You guys going?

826
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:53,437
We have a mysterious something to get to.

827
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:55,038
- It was a great party.
- Thanks.

828
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,555
Let me get you a favor.

829
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,151
- Chocolate chip.
- And they're warm.

830
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:02,505
Oh my God.

831
00:29:02,546 --> 00:29:03,695
Listen, kid,

832
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,211
one more piece of advice.

833
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:06,691
Don't bond with the old lady next door.

834
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:08,495
- Mrs. Weidemeyer?
- You see her door open,

835
00:29:08,577 --> 00:29:09,727
dive for cover. And whatever you do,

836
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:11,122
do not tell her you have a car.

837
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:12,434
Old ladies are giant con artists.

838
00:29:12,557 --> 00:29:13,994
- Con artists?
- They start small.

839
00:29:14,117 --> 00:29:15,306
Trips to the market and the yarn shop,

840
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:16,538
but before you know it you're picking up

841
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:17,727
their prescriptions at 11:00 at night

842
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:18,877
and driving them to the hospital

843
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,148
when their hips break. And you think...

844
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,077
they only have two hips,
how many can they break?

845
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,103
18.

846
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:24,374
'Cause they break the same hips

847
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,524
over and over.

848
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:26,672
Got it.

849
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:30,652
Sweetie,

850
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:32,416
my throat's a little dry.

851
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,714
Could you get me a lozenge?

852
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:36,560
Sure.

853
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:42,059
- That girl is not normal.
- I'm not disagreeing.

854
00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:43,494
There wasn't a bong in the entire place.

855
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:44,767
When I was her age, everything in my room

856
00:29:44,808 --> 00:29:46,079
was either a bong or something I could

857
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,229
make into a bong.

858
00:29:47,311 --> 00:29:48,867
I was 25 before I owned an appliance.

859
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:50,347
It was a used microwave that had permanent

860
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:51,454
soup stains and I'm pretty sure

861
00:29:51,537 --> 00:29:52,562
radiated my ovaries.

862
00:29:52,603 --> 00:29:54,204
- We should hit it.
- Mmm.

863
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:55,680
So remember, rules of the road,

864
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:57,404
- no putting your seat back.
- Come on.

865
00:29:57,445 --> 00:29:59,086
- You'll fall asleep.
- So?

866
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:00,481
So it's not fair that you
get to sleep and I don't.

867
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:02,286
And if you put your seat
back, you will go to sleep.

868
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:03,353
All right, I'll make you a deal.

869
00:30:03,477 --> 00:30:04,666
I promise I won't fall asleep

870
00:30:04,707 --> 00:30:07,538
if you promise me there's
a bathroom at this thing.

871
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:09,000
Fine. Put your seat back.

872
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:12,654
<i>( Doorbell rings )</i>

873
00:30:12,775 --> 00:30:13,953
( Sighs )

874
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:19,840
Hello, Milly. Glad you could make it.

875
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,503
Thank you for the invitation.

876
00:30:21,504 --> 00:30:22,804
May I take your purse?

877
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:24,184
Why?

878
00:30:24,306 --> 00:30:25,849
I just thought you'd be
more comfortable without it.

879
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:27,960
- Really?
- Really.

880
00:30:28,122 --> 00:30:30,234
I'll keep it. Thank you.

881
00:30:30,315 --> 00:30:33,278
My kitchen remodel is taking forever

882
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,186
so I had to order in.
I hope you like blondie's.

883
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:36,973
I do like them. They pay on time

884
00:30:37,014 --> 00:30:38,312
and don't complain too much.

885
00:30:38,475 --> 00:30:39,490
You rent to them too?

886
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,317
My client list is confidential.

887
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:43,184
Have a seat, Milly.

888
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:44,687
Water?

889
00:30:44,889 --> 00:30:46,757
It's the staff of life.

890
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:49,477
Okay if we just serve ourselves?

891
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:51,304
It's informal, I know.

892
00:30:51,386 --> 00:30:53,132
But we're not sitting
in Downton Abbey, are we?

893
00:30:53,294 --> 00:30:54,146
No.

894
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,663
Not by a long shot.

895
00:30:56,704 --> 00:30:57,882
( Bottle clangs )

896
00:30:58,003 --> 00:30:59,748
I'll cut to the chase here, Milly.

897
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:02,632
I overreacted earlier.

898
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:04,661
When you tried to take my purse?

899
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:06,609
At the backer's rehearsal.

900
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,666
I agree.

901
00:31:07,747 --> 00:31:08,883
But you have to understand,

902
00:31:08,964 --> 00:31:10,183
you forced me to act that way.

903
00:31:10,264 --> 00:31:11,847
How do you figure?

904
00:31:11,848 --> 00:31:13,836
You haven't had a lot of experience

905
00:31:13,877 --> 00:31:15,420
with creative endeavors.

906
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,572
Creating art is not democratic.

907
00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:19,318
These carrots look good.

908
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:21,469
My dance studio is my kingdom.

909
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:23,417
And I am the reigning monarch,

910
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,204
and I am not accustomed to input.

911
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:26,869
You can create all you want.

912
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:28,655
But if you don't have
a stage to put it on,

913
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:29,954
it's useless.

914
00:31:29,995 --> 00:31:31,010
What's on this?

915
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:33,081
- Tarragon.
- Yuck.

916
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:34,461
Look, Milly,

917
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:35,841
we each have a role here

918
00:31:35,923 --> 00:31:36,896
and they're both important,

919
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:38,642
but you stepped on mine.

920
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:40,632
When you're the money person,
you get to do that.

921
00:31:40,754 --> 00:31:42,215
You get to step on people?

922
00:31:42,377 --> 00:31:43,670
Diplomatically speaking.

923
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:45,772
There's no diplomatic way
to step on people.

924
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:47,711
Is this all you ordered?

925
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:49,611
You're always right, is that it, Milly?

926
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:51,388
- You're always right.
- Close to always.

927
00:31:51,428 --> 00:31:52,560
- Really?
- Yes.

928
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:54,702
Well, guess what
the staff of life is, Milly.

929
00:31:54,904 --> 00:31:56,601
It's not water. It's bread.

930
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:57,732
I'm pretty sure it's water.

931
00:31:57,813 --> 00:31:59,104
- It's bread.
- It's both.

932
00:31:59,105 --> 00:32:01,005
They're both important.
People die without water.

933
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,500
We're getting off the subject here.

934
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:03,874
You brought up bread.

935
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,571
For this partnership to work,

936
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:06,824
you need to meet me halfway.

937
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:08,076
You can at least do that.

938
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:09,329
Not if I don't want to.

939
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,147
By the way, do you have any bread?

940
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:12,763
See, this is why nobody likes you.

941
00:32:12,803 --> 00:32:14,703
This pig-headed stubbornness of yours.

942
00:32:14,783 --> 00:32:15,835
No. The reason people don't like me

943
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:17,167
is because I have money.

944
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:18,824
That's not why people don't like you.

945
00:32:18,905 --> 00:32:20,683
If you lost all your money tomorrow,

946
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,381
people would still dislike you.

947
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:23,714
No. They would dislike me

948
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,613
because when I had money
they were jealous.

949
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,068
No one likes people with money.

950
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:28,158
They like Warren Buffett.

951
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,533
Give me a break.

952
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,664
The man owns See's Candy.

953
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:31,876
Everyone likes See's Candy.

954
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:33,169
They like the candy, not the man.

955
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,745
Only his family likes the man

956
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:37,452
because when the man dies
they'll get money.

957
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:39,836
What do you want, Milly?

958
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,493
What's the bottom line here?

959
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:43,068
Bottom line?

960
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:45,736
I'm tired of being considered
just a businessperson.

961
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:47,916
I want to be considered
important in the arts.

962
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:50,261
It's a ballet studio in a small town.

963
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,191
It's a starting point.

964
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:52,362
There's a lot to know.

965
00:32:52,564 --> 00:32:53,857
It's not just about giving money.

966
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:55,393
Well, I want to know all there is.

967
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:56,282
If that's what it takes.

968
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:57,817
Fine.

969
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:00,403
Then I will give you books, DVDs.

970
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:03,353
I will personally teach you
about dance and ballet.

971
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:04,699
And I'll have my pianist

972
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,617
teach you everything
you want to know about music.

973
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:08,250
Wow.

974
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:09,557
What?

975
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,516
Sounds mondo time-consuming.

976
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:14,130
It is mondo time-consuming.

977
00:33:14,252 --> 00:33:15,395
Mm.

978
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:17,477
Let me ask you this, Milly.

979
00:33:17,518 --> 00:33:19,355
Do you want to know the arts

980
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:20,661
or just be perceived

981
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:22,213
as someone who knows the arts?

982
00:33:22,254 --> 00:33:25,805
What kind of time commitment
would the second one be?

983
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:27,602
- Hardly any.
- I'm listening.

984
00:33:27,724 --> 00:33:29,153
Let's make a deal.

985
00:33:29,194 --> 00:33:31,807
I will gladly tell anyone you want

986
00:33:31,848 --> 00:33:34,052
that you are a master of the arts.

987
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:36,094
In exchange, you will leave
the creative end

988
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:37,603
completely to me.

989
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:38,543
What do you say?

990
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,299
Fanny, I think we have a deal.

991
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:41,564
Good.

992
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:43,361
Will you tell people it was my idea

993
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:45,115
to wear the tutus?

994
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:47,239
Absolutely.

995
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:49,525
It was a lovely party.

996
00:33:49,648 --> 00:33:51,444
So grown up.

997
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:53,934
Heavens, I didn't even
think you were old enough

998
00:33:54,056 --> 00:33:55,526
to have a car.

999
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,506
( Chuckles )

1000
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,731
Do you have a car?

1001
00:33:57,732 --> 00:33:59,446
Nope. No car. Just feet.

1002
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:00,589
Oh.

1003
00:34:15,817 --> 00:34:17,817
<i>( Knocking on door )</i>

1004
00:34:22,308 --> 00:34:23,819
Oh. Hey.

1005
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:25,370
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

1006
00:34:25,452 --> 00:34:27,125
I heard you were having a party.

1007
00:34:27,207 --> 00:34:29,003
Oh, yeah.

1008
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:31,493
Guess my invitation got lost?

1009
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,433
So can I come in?

1010
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:35,535
Sure.

1011
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:41,536
Who told you about it?

1012
00:34:41,618 --> 00:34:43,129
Aubrey was cheering at my game.

1013
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,170
She assumed I was invited.

1014
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:47,130
When did you start playing
basketball again?

1015
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:48,761
Three weeks ago.

1016
00:34:48,762 --> 00:34:50,396
- Oh.
- Yep.

1017
00:34:50,518 --> 00:34:52,559
It's kind of been a while
since we've talked.

1018
00:34:52,682 --> 00:34:56,193
So where are we anyway?

1019
00:34:56,275 --> 00:34:57,622
My apartment.

1020
00:34:57,785 --> 00:34:59,173
Your what?

1021
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:01,133
My apartment.

1022
00:35:01,174 --> 00:35:02,190
It was a housewarming party.

1023
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:04,630
You got an apartment and never told me.

1024
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:07,029
A whole apartment. You actually moved?

1025
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:08,900
- It was sudden.
- So if I had

1026
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,487
shown up at your house with a boom box

1027
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,031
and Peter Gabriel blasting...

1028
00:35:12,072 --> 00:35:13,536
The new owners would have
called the police.

1029
00:35:13,618 --> 00:35:14,838
Right. Okay.

1030
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:18,904
So, clearly this isn't
going to happen, right?

1031
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:21,425
Hey, this isn't about you.

1032
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:22,646
Okay?

1033
00:35:22,808 --> 00:35:25,045
I've been dealing with a lot of stuff.

1034
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,997
My parents completely abandoned me.

1035
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:28,542
I'm suddenly on my own,

1036
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,762
and I had to get furniture,

1037
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:31,063
and redo the floors,

1038
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:32,121
and I don't know if you've ever

1039
00:35:32,202 --> 00:35:33,298
set up utilities, but if you don't

1040
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,602
have a credit card, it's a problem.

1041
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:36,879
And every time I thought
about my apartment and you,

1042
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,425
and you in my apartment with me,

1043
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:40,091
it was weird and confusing.

1044
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:41,393
And I'm like, "what? Is he gonna think"

1045
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,978
"I'm inviting him over
to my big parent free"

1046
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:44,118
"sex palace now?"

1047
00:35:44,158 --> 00:35:46,395
<i>And it freaked me out.</i>

1048
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:47,818
And I had a party to plan
and lettuce to wash

1049
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,241
so I had to put you over there

1050
00:35:49,323 --> 00:35:50,462
in a corner because I just

1051
00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:51,844
couldn't deal with it yet.

1052
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:53,349
Wow.

1053
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,487
You're weirder than I thought.

1054
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,683
And I thought you were pretty weird.

1055
00:35:58,026 --> 00:35:59,245
And why would I just assume

1056
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:00,791
that this is a sex palace, huh?

1057
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:02,946
I don't even know what the
hell a sex palace is.

1058
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:04,654
Don't get me wrong, it doesn't
sound like a bad thing,

1059
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:06,199
but I wouldn't have just assumed

1060
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,054
that this is one of them.

1061
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:08,151
- Hey!
- What?

1062
00:36:08,192 --> 00:36:09,331
So what?

1063
00:36:09,372 --> 00:36:10,876
This isn't gonna happen?

1064
00:36:10,957 --> 00:36:12,625
Oh my God, you're nuts.

1065
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:14,048
You're seriously certifiable.

1066
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,512
I have been calling and texting

1067
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:17,098
and throwing my self-respect out the window

1068
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:18,562
and basically stalking you,

1069
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:20,839
and you just told me
I was outranked by lettuce.

1070
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:22,181
So yeah, it doesn't really seem like

1071
00:36:22,262 --> 00:36:23,442
you want this to happen.

1072
00:36:23,524 --> 00:36:24,580
- Well, I do.
- Oh yeah?

1073
00:36:24,743 --> 00:36:25,760
- Yeah!
- Fine. When?

1074
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:26,817
- Friday.
- 8:00?

1075
00:36:26,858 --> 00:36:27,874
- Fine.
- Great.

1076
00:36:27,997 --> 00:36:30,042
- Bye!
- Bye!

1077
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:36,810
Is the man on fire yet?

1078
00:36:36,932 --> 00:36:38,116
We're not there.

1079
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:39,382
Go back to sleep.

1080
00:36:39,383 --> 00:36:41,016
Where are we?

1081
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:41,955
Took a little detour.

1082
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:43,384
Just have to run a quick errand.

1083
00:36:43,425 --> 00:36:44,323
I'll be back in a second.

1084
00:36:56,328 --> 00:36:57,595
What? I told you to stay in the car.

1085
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:58,697
I thought I'd get some fries.

1086
00:36:58,737 --> 00:36:59,839
I'll get you fries. Go back to the car.

1087
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:01,187
I might want something with my fries.

1088
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:02,984
What? What do you want with your fries?

1089
00:37:03,025 --> 00:37:04,331
I don't know. More fries?

1090
00:37:04,495 --> 00:37:05,883
Go back to the car and I'll bring you

1091
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,150
something you'll like.

1092
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,782
It'll be a surprise. Like a game.

1093
00:37:08,864 --> 00:37:10,783
- You like games.
- You're being weird.

1094
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:12,784
What's going on?
Is the gun behind the toilet or something?

1095
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:17,195
You've got to be kidding me.

1096
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,827
- Michelle...
- You drove all the way to...

1097
00:37:18,951 --> 00:37:20,461
- Where are we?
- Sacramento.

1098
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:21,646
Sacramento? Sacramento?

1099
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:23,399
Please, Michelle, go back to the car.

1100
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,953
Tell me, Scotty, tell me why you drove

1101
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:27,648
200 miles to see mom.

1102
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,853
A woman I've been actively successfully

1103
00:37:29,975 --> 00:37:31,323
avoiding for 121/2 years?

1104
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:33,038
This isn't about you.
I just have to do something.

1105
00:37:33,243 --> 00:37:34,467
- What?
- Please.

1106
00:37:34,508 --> 00:37:36,550
Go back to the car.

1107
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:45,860
Mom.

1108
00:37:45,942 --> 00:37:47,003
Hang on.

1109
00:37:49,862 --> 00:37:51,046
( Mouthing )

1110
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:55,048
I'm kind of in a hurry, mom.

1111
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:56,556
If I don't finish this article now,

1112
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:57,702
I'll have to start all over again.

1113
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:58,804
You know that.

1114
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:03,377
( Sighs )
God.

1115
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:05,746
Susan Sarandon is so interesting.

1116
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,747
Should have been more political.

1117
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,503
Women who are political
are so much more interesting

1118
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,605
than women who are not.

1119
00:38:10,727 --> 00:38:12,279
You want something to drink?

1120
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,587
Coffee and fries, please.

1121
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:15,423
- What are you doing?
- Ordering coffee and fries.

1122
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:17,057
- Why?
- 'Cause you can't sit in a diner

1123
00:38:17,139 --> 00:38:18,650
and not order anything. It's super rude.

1124
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:19,915
Just go back to the car.

1125
00:38:20,038 --> 00:38:21,222
Ignore me. I'm not here.

1126
00:38:21,304 --> 00:38:23,019
- How are the cheeseburgers?
- Compared to what?

1127
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,324
I'll have a cheeseburger.

1128
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:25,670
Is that Michelle?

1129
00:38:25,874 --> 00:38:26,770
Yes.

1130
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:27,995
Why did you bring Michelle?

1131
00:38:28,076 --> 00:38:29,626
Mom, please. Let's just do this, okay?

1132
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:31,094
I'm not prepared for Michelle.

1133
00:38:31,216 --> 00:38:32,522
I didn't dress for Michelle.

1134
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,907
God. Anyway,

1135
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:35,907
did I tell you about the condo?

1136
00:38:35,988 --> 00:38:37,171
Talk and look, mom.

1137
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:38,394
<i>Well, it's perfect for me.</i>

1138
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:40,108
It has two bedrooms

1139
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:42,310
so you can stay in one if you ever visit.

1140
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:44,798
And a bonus room I'm going to
turn into my recording studio.

1141
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,062
Her recording studio?

1142
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:47,816
I told you I was gonna
make an album, right?

1143
00:38:47,938 --> 00:38:48,916
Her recording studio?

1144
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:51,119
No, you didn't. You're not here.

1145
00:38:51,241 --> 00:38:52,384
I always wanted to sing.

1146
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:53,647
And Rufus has pro tools.

1147
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:56,095
Rufus is my new boyfriend. You didn't ask.

1148
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:57,400
He's younger. Not as young as

1149
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:58,746
Susan Sarandon's boyfriend,

1150
00:38:58,787 --> 00:38:59,684
but he's younger than me.

1151
00:38:59,765 --> 00:39:00,908
Well, great.

1152
00:39:00,949 --> 00:39:01,968
- You have the...
- He's 35.

1153
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,844
I have a 35-year-old boyfriend.

1154
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:04,863
Isn't that amazing?

1155
00:39:04,986 --> 00:39:06,047
Not at all.

1156
00:39:06,087 --> 00:39:08,167
You know what's fun? Oceanography.

1157
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:09,268
- What?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

1158
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,082
So, you're buying a condo.

1159
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:13,225
<i>I am!</i>

1160
00:39:13,265 --> 00:39:14,284
My friend Jenny,

1161
00:39:14,448 --> 00:39:15,712
she was looking at it first.

1162
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,383
She wanted to turn the
bonus room into a gym,

1163
00:39:17,384 --> 00:39:19,138
but it's gonna make a much
better recording studio.

1164
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:20,606
I thought I'd try country and western

1165
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:22,074
because I look good in hats.

1166
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:23,420
Silly reason, right?

1167
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:24,481
- Yes.
- No.

1168
00:39:24,522 --> 00:39:25,867
Yes.

1169
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,295
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

1170
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:28,396
Thank you.

1171
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:29,905
Those are unfamiliar words.

1172
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:31,373
Scotty, tell Shania Twain

1173
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:32,556
eyes on her own paper.

1174
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,860
Mom, please.

1175
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:35,166
Oh yes.

1176
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,775
It's just your standard
legal blah blah blah.

1177
00:39:37,857 --> 00:39:39,488
( Sighs )
I don't see where

1178
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,282
the guardian's signature
is supposed to go.

1179
00:39:41,364 --> 00:39:42,546
The what?

1180
00:39:42,668 --> 00:39:43,606
Right there, I think.

1181
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:44,992
The guardian's signature?

1182
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:46,256
My pen's dead. You got a pen?

1183
00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:48,336
Hello? Guardian signature,
what's a guardian signature?

1184
00:39:48,337 --> 00:39:51,393
Scotty Scotty Scotty Scotty
Scotty Scotty Scotty.

1185
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:52,902
( Sighs )

1186
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:54,043
I'm mom's guardian.

1187
00:39:54,206 --> 00:39:56,408
I have to sign all her
financial transactions, okay?

1188
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,528
How many ways can I say no?

1189
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:00,526
Look, she got into a situation.

1190
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,545
That's shocking.

1191
00:40:01,586 --> 00:40:02,932
She bought a house with a boyfriend...

1192
00:40:03,013 --> 00:40:04,154
not Rufus.

1193
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,541
And he was supposed to pay half,

1194
00:40:05,582 --> 00:40:06,723
but they broke up

1195
00:40:06,886 --> 00:40:08,026
and mom didn't want to
get stuck with a house.

1196
00:40:08,027 --> 00:40:08,924
But the only way to get her out of it

1197
00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:10,148
was to have her declared incompetent

1198
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,187
which involved me becoming her guardian.

1199
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:13,776
Are you out of your freaking mind?

1200
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:15,367
Please, just stay out of this.

1201
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:16,875
How did you let her con you into this?

1202
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:18,914
She had to get rid of the house
in order to get the condo.

1203
00:40:19,077 --> 00:40:21,320
I want to make sure I understand
the full crazy here.

1204
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:23,031
She had herself declared incompetent

1205
00:40:23,194 --> 00:40:24,214
to get out of a place to live

1206
00:40:24,418 --> 00:40:25,722
in order to get a different place to live.

1207
00:40:25,763 --> 00:40:26,946
Well, she was supposed to...

1208
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:28,862
No. I haven't gotten to the crazy yet.

1209
00:40:28,903 --> 00:40:30,613
She had herself declared incompetent

1210
00:40:30,613 --> 00:40:31,716
to get out of a place to live

1211
00:40:31,757 --> 00:40:32,898
and you helped her!

1212
00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:34,121
She certainly can't expect me to live

1213
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:35,385
in a place with so many memories.

1214
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:36,934
Who co-signs on a house

1215
00:40:37,097 --> 00:40:38,932
with a guy they know
it's not gonna work out with?

1216
00:40:39,014 --> 00:40:39,910
Well, she didn't know that.

1217
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:40,971
It never works out.

1218
00:40:41,052 --> 00:40:42,643
<i>It will with Rufus.</i>

1219
00:40:42,684 --> 00:40:43,784
Scotty, leave here with me right now.

1220
00:40:43,865 --> 00:40:44,925
Just let me sign this.

1221
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:46,230
She will get you into trouble.

1222
00:40:46,312 --> 00:40:47,495
'Cause that's what she does.

1223
00:40:47,535 --> 00:40:49,777
She drags everyone
into her hole of destruction,

1224
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:51,080
then somehow she climbs out

1225
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,672
- and leaves you there.
- So dramatic.

1226
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:54,466
Maybe you should be the country singer.

1227
00:40:54,548 --> 00:40:56,128
Mom called me and needed help.

1228
00:40:56,211 --> 00:40:57,167
What was I supposed to do?

1229
00:40:57,168 --> 00:40:58,541
Change your number a lot.

1230
00:40:58,666 --> 00:40:59,624
That's what I do.

1231
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,204
She acts like I call her.

1232
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:03,201
I'm not that desperate. I have friends.

1233
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:04,616
I'm making a record.

1234
00:41:04,782 --> 00:41:07,653
<i>I don't see how it's any</i>
<i>of her business anyhow.</i>

1235
00:41:07,778 --> 00:41:09,234
She hasn't cared for 12 years.

1236
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,022
12 1/2.

1237
00:41:11,147 --> 00:41:13,269
I don't know why it matters to her now.

1238
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:16,556
There, mom.

1239
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,012
Take it.

1240
00:41:21,091 --> 00:41:22,089
Michelle?

1241
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,205
I just wanted to see your face.

1242
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,279
( Grunts )

1243
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:36,692
Well, door-to-door service

1244
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:38,981
and I do accept gratuities.

1245
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:42,184
You can't freeze me out forever.

1246
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:45,138
Yes, I can.

1247
00:41:45,263 --> 00:41:46,636
But I won't.

1248
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,750
I should get going.

1249
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:57,204
Give me some warning
before you get married again.

1250
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:58,534
There's usually not that much time.

1251
00:41:58,535 --> 00:41:59,700
( Chuckles )

1252
00:42:08,935 --> 00:42:11,639
I'll sleep at my place tomorrow.
