Previously on <i>Bunheads</i>...

2
00:00:01,113 --> 00:00:02,216
I think I forgot to finish high school.

3
00:00:02,239 --> 00:00:03,887
I'm a dropout. Not even a dropout...

4
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:05,454
dropping out implies action.

5
00:00:05,576 --> 00:00:07,679
I just... didn't finish.

6
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:10,151
My dad and Faye Mendelson
set the wedding location.

7
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:12,170
- Fun.
- It's the same place he married my mom.

8
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:13,570
No way.

9
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:16,084
The day I lost my husband
was the worst day of my life.

10
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:19,546
Of course I lost him to the divorcee
in the jeggings across the street.

11
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,317
- So what's up with Charlie?
- What do you mean?

12
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:23,336
What did he do to make her dump him?

13
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:25,849
Nothing. He was totally smitten.

14
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,581
( Gasps )

15
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:28,528
Here's to being dumb.

16
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:30,300
I have a masters in oceanography.

17
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,526
So they let high school dropouts get PHDs?

18
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,336
I didn't say I was a high school dropout.

19
00:00:34,337 --> 00:00:36,440
I'm guessing that you and
me tonight, we're not...

20
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:38,089
No. Not tonight.

21
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,654
What did you say to him?
Maybe you can un-say it.

22
00:00:39,736 --> 00:00:41,714
- In a better outfit.
- Did he say something bad to you?

23
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:45,753
Saw your moves.

24
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,153
Bartender, the girl.

25
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:49,049

27

Stop.

Everyone, just stop.

29
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:09,528
You just killed Baryshnikov.

30

31
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:13,361
Well, would you mind
showing us the combination

32
00:01:13,442 --> 00:01:14,473
again, Jordan?

33
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:15,668
Oh, sure.

34
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,234
What have I got but loads of time

35
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,840
and sincere enthusiasm

36
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:20,530
to show you the same freaking thing

37
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,426
over and over again?

38
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:23,703
Move.

39
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:38,538
Do that.

40
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:44,553
They kill Baryshnikov again?

41
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:45,872
Yep.

42
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:47,726
I just need to do something
on the computer here.

43
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:50,198
I'll be super quick. Quiet as a mouse.

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,465
<i>( Computer dings )</i>

45
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,360
From now on, Jordan, sir.

46
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:57,409
Let's try it again, everyone.

47
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,428
Five, six, seven, eight.

48
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,571
Sharper, Ray-Ray.

49
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,651
Cleaner, Ginny. Cleaner.

50
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,184
Be smaller, Boo.

51
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:09,482
- Smaller?
- Don't talk back.

52
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:12,022
Matisse, stop. Stop!

53
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:13,394
Focus, okay.

54
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:14,885
Without focus, your life
is gonna be jumping

55
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:16,619
from alcoholic boyfriend to another.

56
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,111
Is that what you want?

57
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:19,724
I don't think so.

58
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:21,256
Hey, Jordan, let's take five here.

59
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:22,627
<i>They look like they need a break.</i>

60
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,531
When don't they? Take five.

61
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:27,224
Jordan, your group is wilting here.

62
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:28,273
And the kids in the corner,

63
00:02:28,473 --> 00:02:29,321
what's up with them?

64
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:30,450
They wanted to stretch before class.

65
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,377
I mean, come on.

66
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:32,547
"Be smaller."

67
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:33,554
What a jerk.

68
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,047
I hate him so much.

69
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,094
Me too.

70
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:37,506
But I'm also in love with him.

71
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:38,554
Me too.

72
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:40,168
- But not anymore.
- Same here.

73
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,861
He's so insane today.
He hasn't even noticed

74
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:43,352
- that Melanie isn't here.
- Why isn't she here?

75
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:44,764
He's looking.

76
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:45,812
- They're being babied around.
- Absolutely not.

77
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:46,942
You're not challenging them enough.

78
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:48,312
You can see it in their dancing,

79
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:49,361
their barre work, their legs,

80
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:50,651
- their posture.
- Jordan.

81
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:52,184
Everything they do, it's not correct.

82
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:54,764
We're talking a break.
We're not doing anything wrong.

83
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:56,981
Bastard's gotten into my head.

84
00:02:56,982 --> 00:02:58,958
Sasha's AWOL too, by the way.

85
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,127
Well, I know where she is.

86
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:01,458
Apartment hunting, and she found one.

87
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:03,191
- Really?
- In that building her aunt owns.

88
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:04,926
- She moves in next week.
- Who's she living with?

89
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:05,853
No one. It's just her.

90
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:07,063
Her own apartment?

91
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,119
I used to dream about
getting married to Jordan

92
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,054
and living in our own apartment.

93
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:12,786
Kissing him on the cheek
when he comes home,

94
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:14,643
<i>and making dinner for him every night.</i>

95
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:16,497
- But not anymore.
- Same here.

96
00:03:16,498 --> 00:03:18,070
He's been a jerk forever, Matisse.

97
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:19,563
Are you just catching up?

<i>Boo, that's your phone.</i>

<i>They don't want to be you.</i>

Mom, hey, I'm at class so make it quick.

103
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:30,834
The TV fell over?

104
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,444
Did it fall on anyone?

105
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:35,266
How can you not be sure?

106
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,758
Better not let him see you.

I know you can do it.

Please stop doing that!

110
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:42,103
So just Lonnie is missing?

111
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:43,677
Well, do you see any parts of Lonnie

112
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,209

115
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:50,140

No.

Wait, what is that? Is that screaming?

It's Grant and Dominik.
They're locked in the dressing room.

- Why?
- They know why.

181
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:43,005
White wine is actually great.

182
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:45,028
<i>You're in a chipper mood, Claire.</i>

183
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:46,308
I am.

184
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:47,711
Because...

185
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:50,931
I am not gonna let it get me down.

186
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:52,458
Let what get you down?

187
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,688
Here we go.

188
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:57,867
Hello, Ginny's father
is marrying Faye Mendelson

189
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:58,941
in less than a week.

190
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:00,344
Yeah, we're going.

191
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:01,664
You are?

192
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:03,067
<i>If that's okay?</i>

193
00:07:03,068 --> 00:07:05,091
Oh, of course it is.

194
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,289
I want you to go, Dougie,

195
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:07,775
really I do.

196
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,549
So how's the real-estate business

197
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,788
treating you these days, Claire?

198
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:12,893
- I hear it's, you know...
- Have you seen...

199
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:16,279
That insane wedding blog that they have?

200
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,971
- No, not me.
- Yes, I have. Many times.

201
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:20,903
Faye Mendelson is chronicling
their whole stupid life

202
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:22,079
on this blog

203
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,064
<i>with photographs and diary entries.</i>

204
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:26,130
Gil is surfing now

205
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:28,885
and the man is 45.

206
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:30,506
<i>He's starting to surf.</i>

207
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:31,600
He likes it, mom.

208
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:32,856
And all those photos of Faye

209
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,598
cuddling her dog like that,

210
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:37,473
it's just bestial. Call the SPCA.

211
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:38,892
( Chuckles )

212
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:40,513
What's so funny?

213
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:43,431
Nothing. I guess.

214
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:45,943
Mom. You're being busted
by the valet police.

215
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:47,482
Bring 'em on.

216
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:48,982
Come on, Claire.
Let's go give them your keys

217
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:51,494
before this becomes
an international incident.

218
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:53,398
All right.

219
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:54,977
You're really going
to the wedding, Dougie?

220
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,760
I mean, I know you knew him first,

221
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:58,097
but he's changed so much.

222
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,204
- Wow.
- She's on that blog night and day

223
00:08:00,205 --> 00:08:02,027
commenting anonymously.

224
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:03,322
The website blocks dirty words,

225
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:04,701
or there would be some saucy things

226
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,808
written about those dogs. Believe me.

227
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,875
Oh, check this out.

228
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,252
What is that? A box?

229
00:08:10,414 --> 00:08:11,670
That's my bridesmaid dress.

230
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,291
- This has got to be a mistake.
- It's not.

231
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:14,912
It's a giant rectangle, why?

232
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:16,856
Because every time I go to
my dad and Faye's place,

233
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,275
Faye stares at my boobs.

234
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,774
She told my dad that they remind her

235
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:21,556
of my mom's boobs and she
doesn't want to be reminded

236
00:08:21,637 --> 00:08:22,934
of my mom's boobs at the wedding.

237
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:24,554
So she's forcing me to wear a dress

238
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:25,811
shaped like a shower curtain.

239
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:27,310
Cruel and unusual.

240
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:29,173
( Sighs )
I don't want to look at it anymore.

241
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,592
So where have you been?

242
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:31,604
What do you mean?

243
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,536
I mean where have you been?

244
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:33,550
I never see you anymore.

245
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,089
I see you every day at school.

246
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,466
You're skipping ballet.
You don't answer my texts.

247
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:37,966
Dad's got me touring colleges.

248
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:39,708
- Really?
- We just got back from driving around

249
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:40,883
U.C. Santa Barbara.

250
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,260
- Really?
- Yeah.

251
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:43,880
Okay, well at least answer my texts.

252
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:44,950
Some of them are even important.

253
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:46,144
I will. I promise.

254
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:48,119
Here.

255
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,272
While you have a shot.

256
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:50,507
Good thinking.

257
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:01,660
<i>( Laughing )</i>

258
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,447
Of all the gin joints in all the towns

259
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:08,287
in all the world,
she has to walk into mine.

260
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,139
"Casablanca."

261
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:11,579
I know "Casablanca".

262
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:13,473
- Okay.
- I've seen "Casablanca."

263
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:15,324
I can spell Casablanca.

264
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:16,517
I've been to Casablanca.

265
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,670
I was just trying to be cute.

266
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:18,987
I thought "hey there" would be boring

267
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,016
so I thought I'd throw in a...

268
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,280
never mind. Starting again.

269
00:09:22,486 --> 00:09:24,543
- Hey there.
- Hey.

270
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:25,943
- For me?
- Yep.

271
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,219
- Guilt gift?
- Yep.

272
00:09:27,342 --> 00:09:28,493
I like the wrapping paper.

273
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:29,894
It's my 2004 tax return.

274
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:31,129
Nice.

275
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,297
"Finding Nemo."

276
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,491
See? It's the perfect thing for us

277
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:36,397
'cause you're an expert on the ocean,

278
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:37,714
and I like talking fish.

279
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,442
Very nice. Thank you.

280
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:41,582
Sorry for what I said.

281
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,353
No worries.

282
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:45,081
I talk, therefore I am.

283
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:46,644
Not always a bad thing.

284
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,743
Can I buy you a drink?

285
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,884
Yes, you can.

286
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,530
Something with bourbon and an umbrella.

287
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:53,601
( Laughing )

288
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:55,000
What are they celebrating?

289
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:55,947
Tuesday.

290
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,840
My favorite holiday.

291
00:09:57,922 --> 00:09:59,691
- So guess what I did?
- Safer not to.

292
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,215
I went online and read your thesis.

293
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:03,849
- You're kidding.
- <i>No.</i>

294
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:05,001
( Chuckles )
I'm impressed.

295
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,193
Well, don't be. I only understood

296
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:07,470
about 1/10 of it. Plankton.

297
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:09,035
I got that. And your name.

298
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:10,516
And I think you mentioned orca

299
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:11,833
and I did see that movie.

300
00:10:11,956 --> 00:10:13,150
That's probably less than 1/10, right?

301
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:14,425
Did I mention I didn't finish high school?

302
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,050
Points for trying.

303
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,144
Guess that alcohol buzz
is starting to wear off.

304
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:22,210
Yep. Now they all get tired.

305
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:24,035
And the one on the diet
eats every cold French fry

306
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,212
she can find.

307
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:26,225
They'll probably leave soon.

308
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:27,685
And then you'll be all alone.

309
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:29,265
Might as well just close.

310
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:31,131
With the whole night ahead of you?

311
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:32,549
How will you fill the time?

312
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:36,115
And then I got into this whole thing

313
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:37,412
with the lady I was understudying

314
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:38,995
'cause I started dating her husband.

315
00:10:39,117 --> 00:10:41,468
They were separated... well,
he said they were separated,

316
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,806
but I should have known
something was weird

317
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:44,428
when he never let me
come over to his house.

318
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:47,144
I had to go to the corner
of Sixth and 53rd

319
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:48,765
and get in line at this halal cart

320
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:50,225
and I wasn't supposed to move

321
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:51,968
till he showed up and
dropped a note in my purse

322
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:53,833
telling me which hotel to meet him at.

323
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:55,334
And since I didn't have
a phone number for him,

324
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,874
if he was late, I just ordered,

325
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:58,617
and if he still didn't show I had to eat

326
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:00,604
'cause otherwise I'm weird. Whatever.

327
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:02,104
The point is she finally found out,

328
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:03,482
got mad and then never missed a show

329
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,779
so I never got to go on.

330
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:06,928
Plus I smelled like garlic
sauce the entire run.

331
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:08,590
That is not a true story.

332
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:09,642
Okay, fine, you're right.

333
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:11,022
It was a Mr. Softee truck.

334
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:12,563
( Chuckles )
Scotty?

335
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,712
You have flower pots?
Who gave you flower pots?

336
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:15,766
What are you doing here?

337
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:16,901
You kill flower pots.

338
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,197
The flowers and the pots. You walk by

339
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:19,820
and they fling themselves off windowsills.

340
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:21,725
I can't believe this.
Are you a lounge singer now?

341
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,428
Long stories to have beer by.

342
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,293
Wow, I just...

343
00:11:25,374 --> 00:11:27,280
Oh, sorry. This is my brother Scotty.

344
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:28,495
Scotty, this is Godot.

345
00:11:28,536 --> 00:11:29,955
Well, hello, young man.

346
00:11:30,118 --> 00:11:31,212
I'm so glad to see you.

347
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:32,672
Come in, come in.

348
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,699
Oh boy, I...

349
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,400
It's okay. Another night.

350
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:37,496
It's good to meet you.

351
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:38,996
You too.

352
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:41,834
Seriously? Even Mrs. Robinson's

353
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:42,766
giving you a weird look right now.

354
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:44,185
I thought you were in Madison.

355
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:46,508
Well, a funny thing happened
on the way to Madison.

356
00:11:47,393 --> 00:11:49,098
So... Madison.

357
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,763
Right. So I was on my way to Madison

358
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:52,142
and I stopped at this diner

359
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:53,685
and there was a hostess.

360
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:54,903
Not even a waitress?

361
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:56,446
A hostess is a step up from a waitress.

362
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:57,826
No.

363
00:11:57,947 --> 00:11:59,124
You're a waitress first
and then a hostess.

364
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:00,383
- It's a promotion.
- Not at all.

365
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:01,680
Well, she was a redhead

366
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:02,817
so one thing led to another.

367
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:03,996
Oh no. You got married again?

368
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:06,796
- Never made it out of Tupelo.
- Scotty! - I know, I know.

369
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:08,055
How many marriages does this make?

370
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:09,679
- Four?
- You're asking me?

371
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,789
No, four. This makes four.

372
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,926
Oh my God.

373
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,672
But you know, she was different.

374
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:16,539
- How?
- She spoke very little English.

375
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:17,797
Perfect.

376
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,543
But she had these eyes that were epic.

377
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,289
I felt if I could just
stare in this woman's eyes

378
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:22,709
for the rest of my life,

379
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,414
I would be a very happy man.

380
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,282
So what happened? Ooh, cake.

381
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,271
Well, the first month was great.

382
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:29,772
And then we started fighting,

383
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:31,072
and then we got engaged,

384
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:32,289
then we fought some more,

385
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,507
and then I found out she wore

386
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:34,846
colored contact lenses.

387
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,510
That's when I realized, big mistake.

388
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:37,891
What else was there to think?

389
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:39,271
Next thing I know,
it's the day of the wedding

390
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:40,814
I'm standing at the altar in my rented tux

391
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:41,950
and she's hurtling down the aisle

392
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:43,493
like a giant crinoline comet,

393
00:12:43,574 --> 00:12:44,507
and I'm thinking to myself,

394
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:46,131
"I have got to get out of this."

395
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,268
- So you bolted.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

396
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,054
- When?
- Right after "YMCA."

397
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:50,556
Well, you don't want to miss that.

398
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,383
So I wrote her a note,
I grabbed you some cake,

399
00:12:52,545 --> 00:12:54,006
and I exited stage left.

400
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:55,305
Can I give you a piece of advice?

401
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:56,482
Sure.

402
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:58,249
If you keep getting engaged
to perfect strangers

403
00:12:58,372 --> 00:12:59,687
and then bailing on the wedding night,

404
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:01,413
you have to buy a tux.

405
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:02,811
I keep marrying the wrong girl.

406
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:04,331
You keep marrying mom.

407
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:05,729
Well, that's not too
disturbing of a statement.

408
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,496
Well, if the creepy
psychological profile fits.

409
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:10,127
You mind if I crash here for a few days?

410
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,442
Couch is all yours.

411
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,593
Thanks.

412
00:13:12,675 --> 00:13:15,142
Well, so, this is the new pad.

413
00:13:15,306 --> 00:13:16,950
It's not what I pictured at all.

414
00:13:17,032 --> 00:13:18,101
No? What'd you picture?

415
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:20,238
Something less decorated
and without a roof.

416
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,389
You're hilarious.

417
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:22,540
How long do you plan to be here?

418
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:23,855
Why, you gonna have your mail forwarded?

419
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:25,376
Just asking.

420
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:27,388
How attached are you to your toothbrush?

421
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,075
There's an extra one under the sink.

422
00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:32,363
I don't know what problem
you had with this girl,

423
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,089
but boy, could she pick a cake.

424
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:45,269
I know. I can't imagine what
that must have felt like.

425
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:46,584
Hey, I grew up with him.

426
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,229
No one knows how flaky
he is better than me.

427
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:50,448
Hey, what'd you do to the coffee guy?
He hates your guts.

428
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:52,462
Yes, absolutely. Send it all C.O.D.

429
00:13:52,668 --> 00:13:54,641
Toss it in a box,
tape it up and ship it off.

430
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:56,449
Throw some bricks in
'cause they charge by weight.

431
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:57,600
What are you doing?

432
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:58,915
Getting your stuff.

433
00:13:58,916 --> 00:13:59,984
Oh good.

434
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:01,710
Oh, I'd rip that letter up.

435
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,847
I mean, seriously, it's not even
remotely heartfelt or poetic.

436
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,944
And it just makes him seem way
smarter than he is, trust me.

437
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,218
Hey, get my purple sweater back.

438
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:08,657
Hold on a second, Mandy.

439
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,342
- You have a purple sweater?
- It's a very nice purple.

440
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:11,698
Does Mandy know you're gay?

441
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:13,014
- Michelle.
- It might make her feel better.

442
00:14:13,015 --> 00:14:14,328
Just get the sweater.

443
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:16,179
Mandy, there's a purple sweater?

444
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:17,617
Oh really?

445
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:18,645
She says it's hers.

446
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:19,713
It is not hers.

447
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:21,727
- I believe her.
- Great.

448
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:22,919
Oh no no. I'm here. I'm here.

449
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,191
I'm not going anywhere, Mandy.

450
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:25,344
I'm not my brother.

451
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:26,988
I'm gonna check out the rest of the town.

452
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:28,508
What stores have you not alienated yet?

453
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:30,068
No, how bad was the sex, Mandy?

454
00:14:30,273 --> 00:14:31,710
- Oh, come on.
- She hung up a minute ago.

455
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,107
Oh, thank God.

456
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:34,666
- A purple sweater?
- It's more like lavender.

457
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,637
So not better.

458
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,527
All right, everyone. Places at the barre.

459
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:40,785
<i>Port de bras.</i>

460
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,905
One. Open, two.

461
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:45,917
And <i>demi plie.</i>

462
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,889
<i>And stretch.</i>

463
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,695
<i>And demi plie.</i>

464
00:14:49,777 --> 00:14:50,844
I'm here.

465
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:52,363
Keep moving, boys. Keep moving.

466
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:53,923
I'm so sorry. So so sorry.

467
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:54,992
I am just gonna set them up here.

468
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,387
Over here, guys.

469
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:57,456
Oh, what's this?

470
00:14:57,538 --> 00:14:59,056
Beaver.

471
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:00,618
Beaver.

472
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,588
<i>Beaver. Beaver.</i>

473
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,780
Beaver.

474
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:04,929
His name's Beaver?

475
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,243
Beaver.

476
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:08,008
What did I say about ignoring me?

477
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,774
Beaver: <i>You're not my mom.</i>

478
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:11,416
Boo: <i>Okay, but right now I am your mom.</i>

479
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:12,566
Okay? Now come on.

480
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,881
- His name's Beaver?
- Sorry, guys.

481
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:15,769
Hugely embarrassed. So so sorry.

482
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:17,412
Where are the Legos?

483
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:19,752
- They're in the bag.
- <i>This isn't all of them.</i>

484
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,037
<i>- I want to make a castle.</i>
<i>- Well, make a condo. That's fun too.</i>

485
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:24,310
His name's Beaver?

486
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,199
Yes, the kid's name is Beaver.

487
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:27,513
- Deal.
- <i>Boo.</i>

488
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,114
I'm sorry.

489
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:30,634
Carl was supposed to
take them off my hands,

490
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:32,810
but then he got held up at work
and it was either skip ballet

491
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:35,232
- or bring them here.
- Okay, this is a one time thing, right?

492
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:36,998
A one time thing. I promise.

493
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:38,682
And Carl will be here
any minute to take them.

494
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,105
Alright, everyone. Let's continue.

495
00:15:41,146 --> 00:15:42,911
<i>Demi plie.</i>

496
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:44,307
And stretch.

497
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:45,826
And <i>demi plie.</i>

498
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:47,592
<i>( Laughing )</i>
<i>Chris, nose!</i>

499
00:15:47,674 --> 00:15:49,604
- What? What happened? - I want
that out of your nose right now, young man.

500
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:51,698
You do not know whose nose that's been in.

501
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:53,423
I'm sorry.

502
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:55,689
And demi plie.

503
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,009
And stretch.

504
00:15:57,215 --> 00:15:58,411
And <i>demi plie</i>

505
00:15:58,535 --> 00:15:59,934
<i>Ooh, purple. Beaver</i>

506
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:01,215
your hand is down your pants again.

507
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:02,987
Nobody wants to see that.

508
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:04,428
Sorry.

509
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:05,955
I am so sorry if you guys saw that.

510
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,182
I am so, so sorry.

511
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:10,573
And <i>demi plie.</i>

512
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:11,644
And stretch.

513
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:12,920
I got them.
( Groaning )

514
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:13,871
I got them, Michelle.

515
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:15,520
Okay, guys?

516
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,251
Get in the car.
We're going back to the house.

517
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,188
- Aw, I like it here.
- <i>So do I,</i>

518
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:20,467
but we're in the way.

519
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:21,744
So we're going to the car now.

520
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:23,394
<i>- No!</i>
<i>- Okay, guys.</i>

521
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:25,084
Listen, if you get in my car,

522
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,445
I'll give you candy.

523
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,887
Stranger danger!

524
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:29,535
He's not a stranger, Beaver.

525
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:30,608
He's your uncle Carl.

526
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:31,557
Now get in the car.

527
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:33,165
Come on.

528
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:34,978
( Moans )

529
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:36,463
Don't touch me.

530
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:37,782
<i>( Door closes )</i>

531
00:16:37,823 --> 00:16:39,101
Okay, people, let's get this class

532
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:41,699
moving again. Come on.

533
00:16:41,904 --> 00:16:43,224
You heard the woman.

534
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:45,780
And <i>demi plie.</i>

535
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:47,470

And <i>grand plie.</i>

539
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:55,801
And stretch.

540
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,314
- Eat, mommy.
- But I'm off Vicky.

541
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,467
(Folk music playing)
I wanted Asian food.

542
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:00,822
Everything's getting cold.

543
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:03,491
- And sticky.
- Chris, stop playing with your spoon.

544
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:04,682
I'm still sticky.

545
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,530
What is this and how did
it get all over me?

546
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:08,419
It's what our lives are now, Carl.

547
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,939
We're sticky and we're tired.

548
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,129
Adjust.

549
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:21,723
Those two have kids?

550
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:23,448
There's nothing else to
do in this town. Come on.

551
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:26,528
Greetings, <i>señorita.</i>

552
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:28,117
- He's talking to me.
- I guessed as much.

553
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:29,339
Hi there. Nice T-shirt.

554
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,804
It's my Sunday best.

555
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:31,863
It's good to see you again, man.

556
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:33,492
You too. Man.

557
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:35,568
We'll have... what do you think?
Tequila shots?

558
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:37,359
It's Christmas morning all over again.

559
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,682
<i>He gets younger every time I see him.</i>

560
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:40,944
He gets hotter every time I see him.

561
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:42,695
You disgust me with your carnal ways.

562
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:45,586
Okay, help me find wife number four.

563
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:47,052
- Five.
- Whatever.

564
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,885
How about blonde pixie-cut behind me?

565
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:50,066
- No.
- Why?

566
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:51,654
- She's my manicurist.
- So?

567
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:53,321
So if something goes wrong, I'll
have to find another manicurist.

568
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,952
Or a town with more than one manicurist.

569
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:56,906
Okay, back table,

570
00:17:56,907 --> 00:17:58,209
brunette with the bangs.

571
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,350
- <i>Nyet.</i>
<i>- Why?</i>

572
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,651
- She's with a guy.
- I don't care.

573
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:01,915
She's the mother of one of my students.

574
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,096
Fine.

575
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,399
Red beret and leggings?

576
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:05,987
- Bible study teacher.
- Moving on.

577
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:07,533
Ponytail by the planter?

578
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,041
Bagel chip girl at the farmers' market.

579
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:10,425
Fat broad by the window?

580
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:11,729
She works with Truly, and you can't

581
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,113
sleep with Truly either.

582
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:14,498
- Why not?
- 'Cause she's just weird.

583
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,127
Look, if you're gonna block
all my action tonight,

584
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:17,755
I say you can't sleep
with Junior over there.

585
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,301
He's the only bartender I know in town.

586
00:18:19,302 --> 00:18:21,013
If something happens, I won't
be able to get a drink.

587
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:22,195
Well, I'm not sleeping with him now,

588
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:23,497
- so ha.
- Good.

589
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:24,882
Why good?

590
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:26,266
Well, he's not your type.

591
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,587
He seems kind of dumb.

592
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,216
He's not dumb. I'll have you know

593
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:31,642
he's an oceanographer.

594
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:32,781
You're kidding. That's a thing?

595
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:34,533
It's a thing.

596
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:36,161
Wow, okay.

597
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:37,831
To oceanography then.

598
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:39,216
Hear hear.

599
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:43,491
Both: Ahh.

600
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:47,156
Mm.

601
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:49,111
You are now and will always be

602
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:50,529
my favorite drinking buddy.

603
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:51,665
It's good to see you too.

604
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:52,961
Keep them coming, son.

605
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:54,906
Tonight, we settle all family business.

606
00:18:54,988 --> 00:18:56,974
And we get to get really really drunk.

607
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,012
Hey, did we pay?

608
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:07,795
- Mmm.
- I don't remember if we paid.

609
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:10,429
You can pay him tomorrow.

610
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:11,929
In kisses.

611
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,050
Sweet, gentle, little oceanography kisses.

612
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,347
I hate running out on a check

613
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:17,522
when I didn't intend to.

614
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:18,901
What?
( Gasps )

615
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:20,521
My ukulele.

616
00:19:20,602 --> 00:19:21,454
You found it.

617
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:22,750
<i>Mm.</i>

618
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,332
Oh.
( Strums )

619
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:26,115
It sounds the same.

620
00:19:26,196 --> 00:19:28,952
- Terrible.
- Yeah. The same.

621
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:31,181
Oh man.

622
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,369
This is the only good
gift mom ever got me.

623
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,112
The only one I ever wanted.

624
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:38,841
Do you remember

625
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:41,395
that ancient console record player we had

626
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:42,448
when we were growing up?

627
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,948
The needle was big and sharp

628
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:45,244
like a nail.

629
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:48,810
And the speaker grills smelled
like wood and cigarettes.

630
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,067
I remember you playing

631
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:53,229
Judy Garland's "Life Is
Just A Bowl Of Cherries"

632
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,417
over and over and over...

633
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:56,714
- I love that song.
- <i>And over and over</i>

634
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,523
and over and over and over and over.

635
00:20:00,524 --> 00:20:01,658
I wonder where that is.

636
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,564
Mom still has it.

637
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,509
She still has everything.

638
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,333
( Sighs )
My ukulele.

639
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,874
Thank you for finding it.

640
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:11,062
<i>You're welcome.</i>

641
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:13,494
Now maybe you can help me find my life.

642
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,804
Mm, I'm gonna need a super big
compass for that one.

643
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:17,546
Ah, what am I gonna do?

644
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:19,451
Brush your teeth.
You haven't brushed your teeth.

645
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,154
I always thought when I grew up,

646
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:22,775
I'd be some kind of big shot.

647
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:24,963
A fat cat with a big cigar.

648
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:27,882
Yeah. Bossing people around.

649
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:29,827
Do something where you wear a uniform.

650
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,488
You'd look really good in a uniform.

651
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,434
I would look good in a uniform.

652
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:35,775
It's not too late to be an astronaut.

653
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,337
Or a fireman.

654
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:38,489
Or a ballerina.

655
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,585
You were supposed to be a ballerina.

656
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,763
Mmm.

657
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:45,229
Astronaut, yeah. I'll be an astronaut.

658
00:20:45,435 --> 00:20:46,997
Nice.

659
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,368
And tomorrow we'll figure out
what your life's supposed to be.

660
00:20:52,135 --> 00:20:53,327
Ballerina.

661
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:58,383
<i>( Rock music playing )</i>
<i>( Shouting )</i>

662
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:03,151
Watch the pivot.

663
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:04,261
Stripy helmet girl?

664
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:05,165
She's like your quarterback.

665
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:06,235
She calls the plays.

666
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:07,632
- Are your pads scratchy?
- Very.

667
00:21:07,673 --> 00:21:09,193
They'll loosen up the more you fall.

668
00:21:09,276 --> 00:21:10,468
- If I fall.
- You're gonna fall.

669
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:11,865
- Right.
- So have fun.

670
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:13,180
Don't be mean.

671
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:14,578
No pushing, no elbows...

672
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:16,139
this is a sport with rules.

673
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,867
- Remember it.
- Got it. Remember the rules.

674
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:19,182
You're not wearing that necklace are you?

675
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:20,128
- Why?
- You like your head?

676
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,320
Losing the necklace.

677
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,087
<i>A couple of pointers,</i>

678
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:25,307
Bam-Bam McGee.
Look at her wrong, you're going down.

679
00:21:25,512 --> 00:21:26,910
I thought we weren't supposed to be mean.

680
00:21:27,074 --> 00:21:28,924
Groan of Arc.
She'll give you some slack for a while,

681
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:30,856
then she gets rough, aggressive. Be ready.

682
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:32,212
Oh, a lot of names to remember.

683
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:34,718
And the twins out there,
Scary Skate and Crashley Olsen,

684
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:35,994
do not get between them.

685
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:39,652
<i>They will squeeze you</i>
<i>like a watermelon seed.</i>

686
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:41,502
This is the time half
the girls who sign up

687
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,776
quit, FYI.

688
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,037
I'm not quitting.

689
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:46,189
I'm ready.

690
00:21:46,353 --> 00:21:47,298
Good.

691
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:49,271
Are my skates on right?

692
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:50,587
<i>( Whistle blows )</i>

693
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:52,107
Only one way to find out.

694
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:00,657
<i>( Whistle blows )</i>

695
00:22:05,138 --> 00:22:07,028
Hold her. She's right behind us.

696
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,344
Hold her. Hold her.

697
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:09,494
Right here.

698
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:15,743
( Grunts )

699
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,551
You okay, Mel?

700
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:22,772
I'm fantastic.

701
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:25,530
Well, get back out there.

702
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:42,412
Where the hell have you been?

703
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,044
- Just out. Why?
- Why?!

704
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:46,001
This is not a time to go
John Gotti on me, Melanie.

705
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:47,630
This is a time of emergency.

706
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:49,141
- What's this?
- Guess.

707
00:22:49,182 --> 00:22:50,404
The bridesmaid's dress.

708
00:22:50,445 --> 00:22:52,035
It's a tank with wings and a rumpus room.

709
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:53,137
What's it doing here?

710
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:54,279
It's the only place it's safe.

711
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,461
If my mother found it,
she might Chablis-up

712
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,725
and take a knife to it.

713
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:57,989
Then you wouldn't have to wear it.

714
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,927
- Don't joke.
- I wasn't joking.

715
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,477
- I have to wear it.
- I know.

716
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,985
Now listen.

717
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:03,535
Why aren't you answering your phone?

718
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:05,370
- Must be off?
- Flake City,

719
00:23:05,492 --> 00:23:07,123
- I won't have it!
- Okay, sorry.

720
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:08,265
You cannot have your phone off

721
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:09,447
from now until the wedding.

722
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,161
- It's crisis time, get it?
- Got it.

723
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:13,770
Faye Mendelson has gone into
a total defensive posture.

724
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,034
She moved the photo shoot up a week

725
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:16,462
to keep my mother off the scent.

726
00:23:16,543 --> 00:23:17,601
Aren't you supposed to do the photo shoot

727
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:18,745
the day of the wedding?

728
00:23:18,908 --> 00:23:20,213
When everyone's already there, yes.

729
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:21,314
But Faye's not taking chances.

730
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:22,986
Oh, she is going to great expense

731
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,861
to make sure my mother doesn't show up.

732
00:23:24,943 --> 00:23:26,697
And she's bringing a trampoline.

733
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:27,756
Why?

734
00:23:27,757 --> 00:23:28,940
I don't know.

735
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:30,203
You'll come with me to the photo shoot?

736
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,507
Help with the dress, the makeup,

737
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:32,648
maybe suicide assistance?

738
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:33,588
Absolutely.

739
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,341
Hi, everyone.

740
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:36,727
Hey.

741
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,359
- Hey.
- Hey.

742
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,847
<i>( Cellphone ringing )</i>

743
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,557
Hello? Mom?

744
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:46,515
Okay, how do you know

745
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:47,573
Faye Mendelson is getting a massage

746
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:48,880
and left her dog in the car?

747
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,388
Are you following her?

748
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:52,509
<i>What does "kind of following her" mean?</i>

749
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,343
<i>You're either following her or you're not.</i>

750
00:23:54,384 --> 00:23:55,486
<i>No, mom.</i>

751
00:23:57,647 --> 00:23:58,789
Hey.

752
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,322
- Hi, Cozette.
- Oh, we're talking.

753
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:05,082
- Yeah, sorry.
- No worries.

754
00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:06,843
No, she will know who it is

755
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:08,398
if something happens to her dog.

756
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:10,119
She will know.

757
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,043
I get what's going on.

758
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,313
What's going on?

759
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,221
Group dynamics are naturally
resistant to alteration.

760
00:24:16,262 --> 00:24:17,531
What is that, like physics?

761
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:18,924
Madonna.

762
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:20,807
So why don't you skate for the team?

763
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:22,240
I thought that's why
you gave me the flyer.

764
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:23,592
My brother and I do the music.

765
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:24,900
When you saw me the other day,
we were getting our

766
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:25,844
set list together.

767
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:26,990
The dog is innocent.

768
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:27,973
He's an innocent party.

769
00:24:28,055 --> 00:24:29,611
Do not touch the dog!

770
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:31,331
You need a name, you know.

771
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:32,395
For what?

772
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:34,279
A skater name. Everyone's got a name.

773
00:24:34,361 --> 00:24:36,245
Oh, yeah.
I haven't really thought about it.

774
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:37,514
We'll think about it. My brother and me

775
00:24:37,555 --> 00:24:39,193
named half the team. Leave it to us.

776
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:40,585
So you're walking down the street

777
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,977
away from Faye Mendelson's car

778
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,410
and the dog is fine.

779
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:45,417
Okay. Go home. Chablis-up.

780
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:46,645
I'll see you later.

781
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:47,956
<i>( Phone beeps )</i>

782
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,330
We should get downstairs.

783
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:51,723
Right behind you.

784
00:24:57,006 --> 00:24:58,399
I don't think you
understand what it's like.

785
00:24:58,521 --> 00:24:59,913
Your parents are normal.

786
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:01,470
They do normal things and eat normal food.

787
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,067
And even though your
mother counts the peas

788
00:25:03,231 --> 00:25:04,950
on everyone's plate to make sure
everyone has the same amount,

789
00:25:05,073 --> 00:25:07,038
I think that's thoughtful.
More thoughtful than wandering the house

790
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,144
at night like Lady MacBeth.

791
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:09,536
Oh shoot, I forgot my shoes.

792
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:11,829
You did not forget your shoes.
I drove you off.

793
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:13,632
I drove her off just like my mother

794
00:25:13,714 --> 00:25:14,696
drives everyone off.

795
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:16,335
"We mock the things we are to be."

796
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:17,522
You know who said that? Mel Brooks.

797
00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:18,792
2,000-year-old man.

798
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:20,634
He was talking about how
we make fun of our parents

799
00:25:20,757 --> 00:25:22,435
and then we grow up
and turn into our parents.

800
00:25:22,517 --> 00:25:24,401
And that line popped
into my head yesterday

801
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,489
so I started looking through
old photo albums of my mother

802
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,251
trying to figure out
exactly when her crazy set in

803
00:25:28,415 --> 00:25:29,521
so I can be prepared.

804
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:30,873
I think it started around college.

805
00:25:30,955 --> 00:25:31,979
That's the first time I saw her do that

806
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,782
really wild-eyed thing she does.

807
00:25:33,986 --> 00:25:35,626
So I guess I've got
about three to four years

808
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,854
before I go barking mad

809
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,125
which is good.

810
00:25:38,248 --> 00:25:39,435
Now I'm ready for it. I can plan ahead.

811
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,361
You know, have a lot of
rounded corners in my house.

812
00:25:41,402 --> 00:25:42,549
Wear soft, bouncy clothing.

813
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:44,064
Stock up on tissue, ice cream,

814
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:45,621
- voodoo dolls.
- Are you Dutch?

815
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:47,587
- What?
- Dutch. Are you Dutch?

816
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,415
- I...
- Your face reminds me of a Vermeer.

817
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:51,479
It does?

818
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:52,750
"The Milkmaid."

819
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,552
I drink milk.

820
00:25:54,716 --> 00:25:56,969
Michelle: <i>All right, everyone.
Butts to the barre.</i>

821
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,755
Well, I should get this over there.

822
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,313
Hey.

823
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:03,525
Genius is often touched with madness.

824
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:04,835
That's what makes it fun.

825
00:26:04,836 --> 00:26:07,662
- Tick, tock.
- I guess so.

826
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,022
Ow.

827
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:12,414
Come on, let's go. Move move move.

828
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:13,971
Up up up. Come on.

829
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:16,348
There's no one in here you can date.

830
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,822
I just thought I'd come watch my sister

831
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:18,888
shape young lives.

832
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:19,953
I'm just teaching a class.

833
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,468
You are just teaching a class.

834
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:22,738
- Stop.
- What?

835
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:23,804
You're being a little bit douchey.

836
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:24,951
I'm not being a little bit douchey.

837
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:25,934
I've never seen you in a position

838
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:27,327
of authority before. Except that year

839
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:28,965
you dressed up like Angie
Dickinson for Halloween.

840
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,236
Ha ha. Go away.

841
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:32,242
I'm not gonna disrupt anything.

842
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:34,250
- Scotty.
- I'm just gonna sit right here

843
00:26:34,332 --> 00:26:36,258
and watch you teach.

844
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,856
I think it'll be interesting.

845
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:39,412
And possibly hilarious.

846
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:43,264
All right, everyone. First position.

847
00:26:43,387 --> 00:26:45,394
<i>( Piano playing )</i>

848
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:51,335
<i>De</i> mi, straight.

849
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,916
<i>De</i> mi, straight.

850
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:55,472
<i>Grand plie.</i>

851
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,092
<i>Nice. Beautiful.</i>

852
00:27:03,174 --> 00:27:04,270
<i>Next group.</i>

853
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:10,727
<i>All right, four turns are not better
than three if you fall, dude.</i>

854
00:27:18,078 --> 00:27:19,702
Cozette, so good, but I need that hold

855
00:27:19,823 --> 00:27:21,651
before you float through.

856
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:22,707
I'm sorry?

857
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:24,453
You have to hit that arabesque strong.

858
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:27,336
And then square everything off.

859
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,514
Then leading with the chin,

860
00:27:28,636 --> 00:27:30,707
arm up and then float through, okay?

861
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:31,681
Ahh.

862
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:33,954
Like this.

863
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:35,052
Yes. Great.

864
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,514
Perfect. Nice.

865
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:38,382
Pointe shoes on, everyone.

866
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:43,945
Wow, that Cozette, she's very...

867
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,245
- Intense?
- And weird.

868
00:27:45,326 --> 00:27:46,503
I mean weird in a good way,

869
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,128
- but who the hell is she?
- Beats me.

870
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,509
And why does she bring
that sketch artist with her

871
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:51,051
- everywhere she goes?
- That's her brother.

872
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:53,042
Oh, okay. Yeah, not any less weird.

873
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:54,745
Who brings their brother
with them everywhere they go?

874
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:56,371
Oh, hey, Scotty.
This is my brother Scotty.

875
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:58,727
Nice hoofing.
Making Michelle look good out there.

876
00:27:58,808 --> 00:28:01,001
Thank you from the president
of "I have no coordination"

877
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:02,098
Incorporated."

878
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:04,737
So seriously, how is she as a teacher?

879
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:06,402
- She's good.
- <i>Really?</i>

880
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:08,108
Accept the answer and go sit down.

881
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,367
I'm sorry, I have to say

882
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:10,991
it is so weird to see you as a teacher.

883
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:12,209
I know, right?

884
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,225
<i>Thanks, Matisse.</i>

885
00:28:13,346 --> 00:28:14,199
You guys have to understand,

886
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,337
when Michelle was a kid,

887
00:28:15,418 --> 00:28:16,595
she hated her ballet teacher.

888
00:28:16,717 --> 00:28:17,773
Okay, we're in the middle of a class here.

889
00:28:17,854 --> 00:28:19,153
No, it was like a deep deep hatred.

890
00:28:19,356 --> 00:28:20,535
An obsessive hatred.

891
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:22,645
And then one night she saw this movie.

892
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:25,975
And it had... Margaret O'Brien,

893
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,316
- remember?
- No.

894
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,940
So, Margaret O'Brien
was this ballet student

895
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:31,133
and she idolized this old ballerina.

896
00:28:31,255 --> 00:28:33,569
She wasn't old. She was older

897
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:34,827
than Margaret O'Brien.

898
00:28:34,828 --> 00:28:37,022
And then one day, this other
ballerina comes to town

899
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:38,686
and steals the lead in "Swan Lake"

900
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:40,311
from Margaret O'Brien's ballerina.

901
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:42,301
So she decides to sabotage
the new ballerina

902
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:43,824
by turning off the stage lights,

903
00:28:43,906 --> 00:28:46,299
but she opens a trapdoor
in the floor by mistake,

904
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:47,702
<i>and the ballerina falls into it.</i>

905
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:48,774
Oh my God, what happened?

906
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:50,383
Paralyzed, wheelchair.

907
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:51,372
That's terrible.

908
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:52,899
To you. To Michelle, it was inspiration.

909
00:28:53,105 --> 00:28:54,178
Okay, Scotty.

910
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:56,529
So Michelle decides to
cut a hole in the floor

911
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,849
of her ballet class

912
00:28:57,973 --> 00:28:59,004
so that old Lady Vinshtick

913
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:00,242
would fall in and paralyze herself.

914
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:01,520
I did not.

915
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:03,006
She breaks in in the middle of the night

916
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,481
and tries to cut
a hole in the floor with...

917
00:29:05,646 --> 00:29:08,821
with safety scissors
and a grapefruit spoon.

918
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:10,142
It didn't go very well.

919
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:11,379
Wow.

920
00:29:11,544 --> 00:29:12,576
<i>Okay, shoes back on? Great.</i>

921
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,143
Back to the center. Go.

922
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:17,938
- Nice kids.
- They sure are.

923
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:19,547
So how much longer you got here?

924
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:20,990
I'm thinking dinner.

925
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:22,476
Don't know. Class, some bookkeeping.

926
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:24,249
You might be on your own tonight.

927
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:25,816
Oh.

928
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:27,096
Okay.

929
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,488
<i>Echappe, echappe, echappe, pas de chat.</i>

930
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:31,953
Five, six, seven, eight.

931
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,206
<i>( Piano playing )</i>

932
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:42,717
Sonic Youth segueing into Little Richard
totally worked last night.

933
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,074
As predicted.

934
00:29:44,238 --> 00:29:46,001
Lil' Wayne segueing
into Brad Paisley did not.

935
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,273
Did you know he was country?

936
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:49,241
The Paisley thing threw me off.

937
00:29:49,406 --> 00:29:51,866
You blending in?

938
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:53,507
- Me?
- Yeah you.

939
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,779
Trying to.

940
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:55,968
The name will help.

941
00:29:56,091 --> 00:29:57,240
Just gotta think of one.

942
00:29:57,281 --> 00:29:59,495
- We already did that.
- You're gonna like it.

943
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,848
But you don't even know me.

944
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:04,253
Yo! Cleo-smacktra, get in here.

945
00:30:05,893 --> 00:30:07,821
Cleo-smacktra?

946
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:09,339
Cool.

947
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,235
That Beaver. He's evil.

948
00:30:13,317 --> 00:30:14,835
There's evilness in that kid.

949
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:16,516
At least I'm not late
to class today. Good.

950
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:18,731
The hand of Lucifer
has touched that child.

951
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:20,330
No time for the dressing room though.

952
00:30:20,371 --> 00:30:21,839
He played us against each other.

953
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:22,816
How did we let him do that?

954
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:24,243
He caught us at a bad time.

955
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,384
I didn't call you doo-doo head.

956
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:27,096
<i>I would never call you doo-doo head.</i>

957
00:30:27,137 --> 00:30:28,155
I can't believe that for a second

958
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:29,580
you thought I would call you doo-doo head.

959
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:30,886
I didn't know what he was saying, okay?

960
00:30:30,968 --> 00:30:32,638
I didn't know what to think.

961
00:30:32,842 --> 00:30:33,984
He's bad. I mean, he's just a bad one.

962
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:36,103
And we fell for it.
Why did we fall for it?

963
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:37,529
- We're tired.
- I'm exhausted.

964
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:40,178
Class is an hour. You and the
kids stay in the vicinity, okay?

965
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:42,379
But I thought you were going
to bring them all in with you.

966
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:44,050
Carl, I can't. I have class.

967
00:30:44,254 --> 00:30:45,558
Well, I've got something too.

968
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:47,310
Something? What something?

969
00:30:47,392 --> 00:30:48,696
You don't have work today.

970
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:49,837
I'm going to the gym.

971
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,141
The gym.

972
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:52,771
Yeah, it's been, like, forever.

973
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,035
You're not going to the gym.

974
00:30:54,198 --> 00:30:55,094
I am going to the gym.

975
00:30:55,217 --> 00:30:56,929
- No.
- Yes.

976
00:30:57,051 --> 00:30:58,231
Okay, fine. But I won't be
here when you get back.

977
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,983
I haven't had time to myself in a week!

978
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,779
You knew that kids were a commitment.

979
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:03,042
These aren't our kids.

980
00:31:03,164 --> 00:31:04,428
You know what I mean.

981
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,609
Carl, please.

982
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:07,484
Fine. I'll skip the gym.

983
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,888
But if I lose definition in my glutes,

984
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:12,374
you're to blame, okay?

985
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:16,451
Carl, please don't be mad.

986
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:18,407
Let's start class, losers.

987
00:31:18,447 --> 00:31:20,159
Just need to stretch a little first,

988
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:21,912
- okay, Jordan?
- Absolutely not.

989
00:31:21,994 --> 00:31:23,216
You three, you're my first group.

990
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,416
We're starting with <i>pirouettes.</i>

991
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:27,535
And <i>tendu.</i>

992
00:31:27,617 --> 00:31:31,693
Fourth, spot spot spot.

993
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:36,502
Two?

994
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:38,784
Two and then you stop.

995
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:40,333
Margaret, how old are you?

996
00:31:40,577 --> 00:31:43,634
- 10.
- 10?

997
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:45,916
I thought, with that attitude
of yours, you were six.

998
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,525
You want to know how many
I could do when I was 10?

999
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:49,625
Like a thousand.

1000
00:31:49,747 --> 00:31:51,622
<i>Do not look weak, Margaret.</i>

1001
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:54,108
Baryshnikov never looked weak.

1002
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,875
Even in "Sex and the City,"

1003
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,272
the man never looked weak!

1004
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:58,793
Jordan!

1005
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,437
I have had it with this attitude of yours.

1006
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,753
Your rudeness.

1007
00:32:01,835 --> 00:32:04,219
And your Baryshnikov this
and Baryshnikov that.

1008
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,616
- Hey, this is not your class.
- No! You are getting

1009
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:06,685
a time-out, mister.

1010
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:08,328
- What?
- Shh. Quiet.

1011
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:10,178
No no no. Look at me.

1012
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:12,273
Look at me.

1013
00:32:12,274 --> 00:32:13,836
Okay, we are here to learn

1014
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,603
and to have a good time.

1015
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:17,946
That's what ballet is all about.

1016
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,385
<i>( Cellphone rings )</i>
<i>Now, I'm going to have to answer that.</i>

1017
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:21,234
Okay? Because I've got school.

1018
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:23,001
And a job. And three kids.

1019
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,262
And that could be news that one
of them just shoved a dump truck

1020
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:26,988
up his nose, okay?

1021
00:32:27,152 --> 00:32:28,673
So I'm going to take five minutes.

1022
00:32:28,756 --> 00:32:30,523
We're all going to take five minutes here.

1023
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:32,783
And when I get back, I expect to see

1024
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:35,455
a brand-new Jordan.

1025
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:36,853
<i>( Chuckling )</i>

1026
00:32:38,661 --> 00:32:40,634
- Yeah?
<i>- Boo, I'm looking for Melanie. Is she there?</i>

1027
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:41,826
- No.
- No?

1028
00:32:41,949 --> 00:32:42,976
Are you kidding? Look again.

1029
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,415
She's gotta be there. I need her here.

1030
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:45,936
- She promised.
- Honey, honey,

1031
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:47,826
take off the frowny face
and put on the smiley face.

1032
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:49,142
What? Boo, listen...

1033
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:50,292
<i>do you have a juice box?</i>

1034
00:32:50,374 --> 00:32:51,813
- Do you want juice?
- <i>Boo. Listen.</i>

1035
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:53,251
- You've got to lose those kids.
- <i>I know.</i>

1036
00:32:53,334 --> 00:32:54,731
Okay, what am I gonna do?

1037
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,238
Look, call Charlie.
He probably knows where she is.

1038
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:58,759
I will.

1039
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:01,471
<i>( Phone beeps )</i>

1040
00:33:01,472 --> 00:33:03,445
All right, everyone. Let's start.

1041
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:04,883
Big smiles now.

1042
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:08,993
Jordan?

1043
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:11,213
Okay, can everyone come
out to the center, please?

1044
00:33:13,802 --> 00:33:16,720
And <i>tendu. Fourth.</i>

1045
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:20,296
Very nice.

1046
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:22,762
All right, let's try it again, please?

1047
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:24,489
And <i>tendu.</i>

1048

Damn it, McGee, I'll get you for that.

<i>( Indistinct chatter )</i>

Oh my God.

1055
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,061
I forgot to go to the photo shoot.

1056
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:57,042
Yeah?

1057
00:33:57,123 --> 00:33:57,972
It went bad, didn't it?

1058
00:33:58,175 --> 00:33:59,549
Oh yes, yes. Very bad.

1059
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:01,652
- Very bad indeed.
- What's on the dress?

1060
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:03,714
- Punch.
- Punch? From what?

1061
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:04,885
Punch from when my mother came

1062
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:06,383
- and threw it all over us.
- Oh my God.

1063
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,636
Where did your mother get punch?

1064
00:34:07,677 --> 00:34:10,305
Oh, there are a variety
of places to get punch, Melanie.

1065
00:34:10,346 --> 00:34:11,921
Ralphs has punch,

1066
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:13,540
and Vons, and Albertsons,

1067
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:15,441
your local pharmacy
stocks many punch products

1068
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:18,270
to throw on people.
Punch is very easy to obtain.

1069
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:21,304
Ginny, I am so sorry.

1070
00:34:21,385 --> 00:34:23,366
I should have told you
why I haven't been around.

1071
00:34:23,488 --> 00:34:25,549
But I got caught up in all this stuff,

1072
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,964
and I'm sucking at school

1073
00:34:27,086 --> 00:34:29,957
and my dad is putting
college pamphlets on my pillow,

1074
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:32,544
and under my breakfast plate,
and in my sock drawer.

1075
00:34:32,545 --> 00:34:35,861
And he keeps going on and on
about the S.A.T.s

1076
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:37,154
and what I'm gonna major in

1077
00:34:37,357 --> 00:34:38,408
and what I'm gonna do for a living

1078
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,025
and what retirement home
I'm gonna end up in.

1079
00:34:40,026 --> 00:34:42,209
And I found this, this...

1080
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:43,503
skating thing,

1081
00:34:43,544 --> 00:34:46,051
and it made some kind of stupid sense.

1082
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:47,102
And I'm just so...

1083
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:49,447
so sorry.

1084
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:53,006
Say something.

1085
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:55,877
You should have been there.

1086
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,265
Where are we? What is this?

1087
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,448
It's Roller Derby.

1088
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,187
Roller Derby? You're in Roller Derby?

1089
00:35:06,268 --> 00:35:08,412
I'm Cleo-smacktra.

1090
00:35:08,492 --> 00:35:10,231
( Stammers )

1091
00:35:10,312 --> 00:35:11,969
How did this enter your world?

1092
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,345
<i>That night at the Oyster Bar,</i>

1093
00:35:13,465 --> 00:35:15,286
when I pulled the chair
out from underneath Godot.

1094
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,741
Godot got you into this?

1095
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:17,752
<i>Not Godot.</i>

1096
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:19,369
She gave me a flyer.

1097
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:20,542
She?

1098
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:24,949
You!

1099
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,769
Hi?

1100
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:28,265
Should you run?

1101
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:32,754
You stay out of this.
You're ruining everything!

1102
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:34,614
I don't know who you are
or where you're from,

1103
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:37,444
or why you know French, or why
you're so close with Mitch Alvarado,

1104
00:35:37,525 --> 00:35:39,021
but Melanie is my friend!

1105
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:39,992
And it's the four of us.

1106
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:42,418
And you need to stay the hell away!

1107
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,237
And I'm Norwegian!

1108
00:35:50,828 --> 00:35:52,444
Does she skate?

1109
00:35:53,822 --> 00:35:56,245
<i>( Whistle blowing )</i>

1110
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:06,830
<i>( Knocking on door )</i>

1111
00:36:06,925 --> 00:36:08,026
- <i>Is everyone decent?</i>
<i>- Yep.</i>

1112
00:36:08,147 --> 00:36:09,615
I was yelling your name for 20 minutes.

1113
00:36:09,778 --> 00:36:11,285
- Didn't you hear me?
- What do you want, Scotty?

1114
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:13,608
I just need a key to get in your place.

1115
00:36:13,689 --> 00:36:15,239
What happened to the key
I gave you yesterday?

1116
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:16,624
I don't know. Misplaced it.

1117
00:36:16,664 --> 00:36:18,824
Is there like a Paradise
Lost And Found somewhere?

1118
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:20,251
Oh.

1119
00:36:20,373 --> 00:36:21,758
Is something wrong?

1120
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:23,959
You're suddenly acting like
every other woman in my life.

1121
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,629
Michelle?

1122
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:27,260
You told me the ukulele was lost.

1123
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:28,604
- What?
- When I asked you where it was,

1124
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:30,194
you told me to my face that it was lost.

1125
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:31,824
It wasn't lost. You had it the whole time.

1126
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:33,535
- Who cares?
- I do. I wanted my ukulele.

1127
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,736
- That was like 20 years ago.
- Is that your excuse?

1128
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:37,731
Oh jeez, I'm sorry.
You know, if you missed it that much

1129
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:38,996
maybe you should have
just bought a new one.

1130
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,301
They're very hot now.

1131
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:42,379
Eddie Vedder just did
a whole ukulele album.

1132
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:43,927
That's how out of ideas he is.

1133
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:45,313
- I'll get it for you for Christmas.
- You're undermining me.

1134
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:46,372
What? How?

1135
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:48,246
Your cracks, your jokes
in front of the girls.

1136
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:50,122
I'm being funny. It's humor.

1137
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:51,385
It's what sets us apart from the apes.

1138
00:36:51,466 --> 00:36:52,648
That whole Margaret O'Brien thing.

1139
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:54,319
- That was funny?
- I can't...

1140
00:36:54,523 --> 00:36:55,826
you basically told them
to cut a hole in the floor

1141
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:57,457
so I'll fall through and paralyze myself.

1142
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:59,657
I didn't tell them to do it.
I told them that you wanted to do it

1143
00:36:59,739 --> 00:37:01,858
to your teacher.
I thought it was a cute story.

1144
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:04,099
- You were planting ideas.
- <i>I told them the plot of a movie.</i>

1145
00:37:04,303 --> 00:37:06,544
I did not write the movie.
How the hell am I the bad guy in this?

1146
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:07,888
This is my life now, Scotty.

1147
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:09,805
This is my home. This is my job.

1148
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:11,434
Those are my students.

1149
00:37:11,638 --> 00:37:14,081
Oh boy. You have snapped
many many caps, my friend.

1150
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:15,021
I'm an authority figure now.

1151
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:16,528
Authority figure? Come on.

1152
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,444
- They look up to me.
- <i>They're isolated kids.</i>

1153
00:37:18,526 --> 00:37:20,076
You're this strange exotic creature.

1154
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:21,788
You're a mermaid. You're Tinker Bell.

1155
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:23,663
So that's why you're here?
To crap all over my new life?

1156
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:24,805
I worked hard for this life.

1157
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:26,558
You got drunk and married a guy.

1158
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,944
<i>- Hard work.</i>
<i>- Hey!</i>

1159
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:29,698
What? I've done it too. No judgments.

1160
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:30,880
Well, he was a great guy.

1161
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:32,511
And his mother has been
really really good to me.

1162
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:34,060
- You're living in a guest house.
- What does that mean?

1163
00:37:34,182 --> 00:37:35,813
It means, it's a one room guest house.

1164
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:39,197
- For a guest.
- Oh, so square footage is the measure of stability now?

1165
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:40,828
What's your square footage, Scotty, huh?

1166
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:42,296
Enjoying your six feet of my couch?

1167
00:37:42,297 --> 00:37:44,212
- Matt Johnson.
- What?

1168
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:45,965
Matt Johnson. He was
my best friend in school,

1169
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:47,677
you dated him, and as
soon as you guys broke up

1170
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,980
he wouldn't talk to me anymore.

1171
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:50,042
What are you yammering about?

1172
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:51,388
You said you never took anything from me?

1173
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:52,692
You took Matt Johnson.

1174
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:54,201
I have no memory of Matt Johnson.

1175
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:55,261
Oh, come on, Michelle.

1176
00:37:55,383 --> 00:37:57,382
Matt Johnson? He was my best friend.

1177
00:37:57,463 --> 00:37:59,094
The two amigos?

1178
00:37:59,135 --> 00:38:01,703
Do you mean Eric Johnson?

1179
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:02,967
Yes. Eric Johnson.

1180
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:03,986
- Wow.
- Doesn't change what happened.

1181
00:38:04,027 --> 00:38:05,087
He was so important to you

1182
00:38:05,168 --> 00:38:06,147
you couldn't remember his name.

1183
00:38:06,229 --> 00:38:07,167
Perhaps I blacked it out. Too much trauma.

1184
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:08,920
Just own up to it, Scotty.

1185
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:10,795
- Take some responsibility.
- <i>What does that have to do with...</i>

1186
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:12,752
You never take
responsibility for anything.

1187
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,506
Oh, says the girl who set
every float on fire

1188
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,014
at the Fourth of July parade
with a cigarette

1189
00:38:16,015 --> 00:38:17,522
and blamed it on rap music.

1190
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:18,909
Why didn't you make me
graduate high school?

1191
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,906
- You did graduate.
- <i>No.</i>

1192
00:38:20,947 --> 00:38:22,537
- I was there.
- That was the ceremony.

1193
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:24,046
I didn't have the credits
to get the diploma.

1194
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,146
Oh, bummer.

1195
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:26,615
You should have made me graduate.

1196
00:38:26,656 --> 00:38:28,612
It was your responsibility to make
sure I was prepared for life.

1197
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:30,161
- Why me?
- You're my big brother.

1198
00:38:30,243 --> 00:38:31,548
By a year!

1199
00:38:31,752 --> 00:38:33,056
All I was supposed to do
was make sure you had beer.

1200
00:38:33,138 --> 00:38:34,688
Why is this funny?
Why are you making this funny?

1201
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:37,175
Because all I wanted was a key.

1202
00:38:37,337 --> 00:38:38,317
That's all.

1203
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,950
And suddenly you're freaking out

1204
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:41,829
and you said ukulele like 60 times

1205
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,156
and I don't even know why
we're having this argument.

1206
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,238
Don't do that. That is so mom.

1207
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,238
She starts stuff, and then
while you're standing there

1208
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:49,993
yelling and screaming
and pulling your hair out,

1209
00:38:50,075 --> 00:38:51,586
she says "I don't even know
why we're having this argument"

1210
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:53,587
when she knows damn well
why you're having the argument.

1211
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,464
She's the one who started this
argument in the first place.

1212
00:38:55,587 --> 00:38:57,342
How did we suddenly get to mom?

1213
00:38:57,424 --> 00:38:59,058
- You brought her up.
- I did not bring her up.

1214
00:38:59,098 --> 00:39:00,364
Well, by being like her,
you brought her up.

1215
00:39:00,486 --> 00:39:01,548
You don't even deal with mom.

1216
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:02,609
I deal with mom.

1217
00:39:02,691 --> 00:39:03,916
Mom needs money, I deal with it.

1218
00:39:03,998 --> 00:39:05,630
Mom needs to move, I deal with it.

1219
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:07,508
Mom needs help hiding out
from the Jehovah's Witnesses,

1220
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,896
I deal with it!

1221
00:39:08,897 --> 00:39:10,285
Why was mom hiding out
from the Jehovah's Witnesses?

1222
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:11,510
It's a long story and they're a very

1223
00:39:11,592 --> 00:39:13,102
non-violent organization so it takes a lot

1224
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:14,488
to get them to the point

1225
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:15,794
where they are someone
you have to hide out from.

1226
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:16,981
Well, that's your choice.

1227
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,145
I washed my hands
of all that a long time ago.

1228
00:39:19,185 --> 00:39:20,328
Yes, I know. How long's it been

1229
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:22,696
- since you talked to mom?
- 12 glorious fun-filled years.

1230
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,452
Oh, very mature, by the way.

1231
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:25,717
Not much has changed.

1232
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,554
Your address, you go to a job every day,

1233
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:29,351
- but not much else.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

1234
00:39:29,474 --> 00:39:31,801
Yeah, it took me way longer to figure
things out than it should have,

1235
00:39:31,923 --> 00:39:33,311
but look at the road map I had to follow.

1236
00:39:33,393 --> 00:39:35,311
The birds ate all those
breadcrumbs, Hansel.

1237
00:39:35,516 --> 00:39:37,516
And boy, do I not want to
hear about all the stuff

1238
00:39:37,598 --> 00:39:39,598
you have to put up with
with that crazy woman.

1239
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:42,415
Because I've dealt with more than a
lifetime's worth of crap from her.

1240
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:44,253
<i>Her obsession with her face and her looks,</i>

1241
00:39:44,294 --> 00:39:45,355
<i>and my face and my looks.</i>

1242
00:39:45,437 --> 00:39:46,621
And her completely fictional take

1243
00:39:46,662 --> 00:39:48,009
on what our family was.

1244
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,581
And if you choose to continue
having negative influences

1245
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:52,214
<i>in your life, then you
have to prepare yourself</i>

1246
00:39:52,254 --> 00:39:53,643
<i>for the consequences.</i>

1247
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,521
You know who told me that?
Fanny, my mother-in-law.

1248
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,154
She told me that you make your own family.

1249
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:58,787
You make your own destiny.

1250
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,257
And there is nothing you cannot change

1251
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:01,441
if you are completely committed to it.

1252
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,516
And I am.

1253
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,421
I am completely committed to it.

1254
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,325
And it doesn't matter
if you believe it or not,

1255
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:09,016
the address has changed
and my life has changed.

1256
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:11,292
- Fine.
- I can do this.
