[All groaning]

2
00:00:05,055 --> 00:00:06,489
It's just Ryan.

3
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:08,991
"Just Ryan"?
I matter.

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,395
Look, I got Usain Bolt's
phone number in my phone.

5
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:14,163
Check it out.
Look at that.

6
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,432
Okay, you guys love me.
What is this?

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,633
Simone's back.

8
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,936
She's the most awesome,
coolest person

9
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:21,270
that's ever been
in this group.

10
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:23,039
Ooh, I wonder
what her new tragedy is.

11
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:24,407
I hope she lost a cat.

12
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:27,610
Sharing a tragedy
with Simone would be mint.

13
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:29,445
Look at you guys.
You're all dressed up.

14
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:31,447
Anne, are you wearing
a dress?

15
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:33,850
- She likes my legs.
- Oh, boy.

16
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:34,951
[Laughs]

17
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:36,886
I put my earring
back in

18
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,555
and had them take out
a little of the gray.

19
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,124
All: Ooh!

20
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:44,394
When she was in the group,
this was the place to be.

21
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,596
Anyone who was anyone
was here.

22
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:47,830
And we danced.

23
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:49,031
I'm fairly certain

24
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:50,833
you're thinking
of Studio 54.

25
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:52,268
See,
that's the kind of crack

26
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:53,669
Simone would never make.

27
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:55,338
She was in it, King.

28
00:00:55,406 --> 00:00:57,373
Not above it,
commenting on it.

29
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:59,308
[All gasp]

30
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:00,877
[All groan]

31
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:03,246
Just me.
Sorry, I'm not Simone.

32
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,481
Lauren hates Simone.

33
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,083
I don't hate Simone.

34
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,218
Maybe I was thinking
about Studio 54.

35
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:11,320
Did I steal a woman
from dick cavett here?

36
00:01:11,388 --> 00:01:12,789
Whenever Simone tells
a story,

37
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:13,990
she can't help

38
00:01:14,057 --> 00:01:15,224
but mutter under her breath.
[Scoffs] Oh.

39
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:18,261
Lauren is, like,
"that event not happen, Simone.

40
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,164
I not believe this.
Gag me with spoon."

41
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:23,733
Your impression of me
is uncanny.

42
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:25,835
She just demands
a lot of attention.

43
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:27,770
And is prone
to exaggeration.

44
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,439
Ah, so a needy liar.

45
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,207
That's who you think
is better than me?

46
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:32,475
- Guys...
- [Gasps] Oh, my God!

47
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,110
She's here!
She's finally here!

48
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,612
Simone!
Simone!

49
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,713
[Laughs]

50
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:40,249
She hugged me.
She's hugging me first.

51
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:41,951
Oh, I'm just so happy.

52
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,286
Yes!

53
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,954
I don't see the appeal.

54
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,956
- I do.
- Yeah, me too.

55
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,892
[Rock music]

56
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,594
I was in the bazaar
in Marrakesh

57
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:54,564
when I saw the nine
most colorful scarves

58
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,933
and thought of the nine
most colorful people I know.

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,435
All: Aww.

60
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:01,904
Anne,
your eyes look so blue.

61
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:04,607
It's the scarf.
It's the perfect color.

62
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:06,742
The scarves are making us
beautiful.

63
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,478
I think you make
the scarves beautiful.

64
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,546
All: Aww.

65
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:11,647
And you must be Ryan.

66
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,815
Oh, I don't need
a scarf.

67
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:13,983
I'm already beautiful.

68
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,184
I don't have a scarf,

69
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:17,253
but I had Yolanda email me
a picture of you.

70
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:20,289
Unfortunately, I'm never
without my watercolors.

71
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,625
[Scoffs]

72
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:24,026
I love it.

73
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:25,361
So Simone,

74
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:27,630
would you like to share with us
why you returned?

75
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:28,798
Is your brother
in a coma?

76
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,666
As you know,
I first joined this group

77
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,970
when my career was cut short
by a tragic injury.

78
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:37,607
And I had to say, "farewell"
to dance.

79
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:39,775
Although there was no evidence
of an injury or a dance career.

80
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:42,678
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Dance career.

81
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,013
I left in search
of the next thing.

82
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,015
I went to Europe,
seeking beauty.

83
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,183
I was making art...

84
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,417
Mmmm.

85
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:51,487
I forgot I'm back
in the states.

86
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:53,689
[Laughter]

87
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,324
And it's not 1937,

88
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:58,327
and you're not
the penguin.

89
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:00,930
You better laugh at that,
or we're not friends anymore.

90
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:05,701
[Forced laugh]
I'm torn about this.

91
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:06,869
[Laughing continues]

92
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,971
I was sketching farm houses
on the seine

93
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,641
when I met a poet...
My soul mate.

94
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:12,909
Can we speed this up?

95
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,143
I've got some things
I'd like to discuss.

96
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:16,746
I had never fallen
so hard for anybody.

97
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:19,048
I asked him to marry me.

98
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,017
And on the day
we were to wed,

99
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:22,518
he disappeared.

100
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:23,986
- Oh, no!
- Ohh...

101
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:26,956
Words do not exist
to express my heartbreak.

102
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:28,524
No, that's not true.

103
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:30,760
There is
an ancient Gaelic phrase.

104
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:32,261
Uh
<i>briseadh croi.</i>

105
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,329
[Whispers]
Yeah.

106
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,697
That's it.

107
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:36,332
Thank you, Benjamin.

108
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,568
"Benjamin"?
You told her your name?

109
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,703
I felt like
she could handle it.

110
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:42,204
It feels good
to be here.

111
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:45,107
But enough about me.
Ryan had something.

112
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:46,776
Yeah, Ryan.
Follow that.

113
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:48,477
She just lost
the love of her life.

114
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:49,745
Mine died.

115
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:53,416
Yeah, like <i>mont</i> ago.
Uck.

116
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,419
Well, as you all know,
work has been a refuge.

117
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,688
My show is everything
to me.

118
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,222
- Oh, you're in the arts?

Okay.

Steven,
who's supposed to be

128
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:19,108
my advocate
and best friend,

129
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,676
informs me that,
from now on,

130
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:22,979
my show is gonna be
15 minutes shorter.

131
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:26,749
Can you believe that?
15 minutes shorter.

132
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:29,185
So, Simone,
where are you staying?

133
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:30,972
- Oh, will you stay with me?
- Stay with me?

134
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,922
Me!

135
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,757
Anne, I'd love to stay
with you.

136
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,158
Yeah!

00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:38,561
The kids are away.
I'll... I'll give you my room.

138
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:39,729
I insist.

139
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:40,997
You sure you don't want
to share a bed?

140
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,765
Oh!

of saying something.

Steven was your friend.

147

And then he cut
your sports show

from 3 hours
to 2 hours and 45 minutes.

149

are these divorce papers?

the boot.

that I respect you,

a cartoon dog to me.

- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

why is this paperwork

00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:07,008
Apparently, he likes
someone in the group.

181
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,243
Really?

182
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:10,379
Oh, he's gonna get taken
to the cleaners.

183
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,447
Can you help him?
Do you do divorces?

184
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:13,615
I'm a prosecutor.

185
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:14,850
I put sleazebags
in the chair

186
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,618
and divorce them
from existence.

187
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:18,920
I want you to think
about helping Danny.

188
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:20,021
Oh.

189
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,089
But more importantly,

190
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,558
can I come to an execution?

191
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:25,727
No, you gotta give it a try
just once.

192
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:27,929
Hi, Mr. K.
Good afternoon, Carrie.

193
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:29,564
Wonderful to see you.

194
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:31,600
[Slapping]

195
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,469
That is one slap
for every 7 1/2 minutes

196
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:35,537
you took from Ryan.

197
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:37,406
Hmm.

198
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:40,509
What the hell?

199
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:42,944
Steven, look at your car.

200
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:44,713
[Gasps]

201
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,982
Sweetheart.

205
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,563
Oh, hey, Lauren.

206
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,764
- Oh, God.
- There you are.

207
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:04,166
<i>Namaste.</i>

208
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,300
What are you doing here?

209
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:06,401
You've never heard
of boundaries?

210
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,602
Simone's not working out.

211
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,037
- [Sighs]
- She's taken over the group.

212
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:10,405
I know it bothers you.

213
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:11,807
I can tell you're pent up.
I'm not pent up.

214
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:13,108
You know where Simone
is right now?

215
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,676
She's at Anne's house
with the group,

216
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:16,211
so that they can paint
each other's beauty.

217
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,279
What?

218
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:18,746
She sent me
an inspirational poem.

219
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:20,515
That stuff sucks.
That's your stuff.

220
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,950
- You get to suck.
- Yeah.

221
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:23,785
We need to eliminate her
from the group.

222
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:26,021
Ryan,
I'm gonna give you

223
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:27,756
the same piece of advice
I gave to Fausta

224
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:29,124
when she wanted
to <i>fusilarte</i> you

225
00:07:29,192 --> 00:07:30,826
- after your first session.
- What?

226
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:32,561
Filed away.
Keep going.

227
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,062
Do nothing.

228
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,465
Trust me.
Trust the group.

229
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:37,532
And in time...

230
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:43,271
Ryan, you came.

231
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,040
Grab a paintbrush
and find someone

232
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:46,174
you think is beautiful.

233
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:47,242
You won't have to look far.

234
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,110
- It's not working out.
- What?

235
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,545
You. The group.

236
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:52,581
We've hit a nice stride
since I joined.

237
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:53,648
You don't fit.

238
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:54,649
Did you read the poem
I sent you?

239
00:07:54,717 --> 00:07:56,078
No, I didn't read
the stupid poem

240
00:07:56,085 --> 00:07:57,919
you sent me by "yee-ahts."

241
00:07:57,987 --> 00:07:59,588
I realize
it's pronounced yeats,

242
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:02,257
but I'm mispronouncing it
to take away its power.

243
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:04,359
You're overreacting.
There's room for both of us.

244
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:06,228
You are wrong.

245
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:07,829
Everybody, a word.

246
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:10,265
Ryan, we find beauty.

247
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,801
I draw Owen.
He's naked.

248
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,703
Doesn't need to be.
Is.

249
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,671
Painting time's over.
She's gotta go.

250
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:19,274
No, no, no.
Ryan, this is Simone.

251
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:22,777
Yolanda is the one
who we don't want.

252
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:23,926
Okay,
that is not helping.

253
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,614
Nor did it help
when you turned

254
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:27,382
my friend's car
upside-down.

255
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,851
That is not
appropriate human behavior.

256
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,219
Okay.

257
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:34,623
Can we just say what is
appropriate human behavior?

258
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,359
Why all the drama?
We like Simone.

259
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:38,727
All right. I didn't
want to have to do this.

260
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,195
But you're gonna
have to choose.

261
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,630
Her or me, okay?

262
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,565
And I think
you will all choose me.

263
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:46,067
Except for
a certain Buxom someone

264
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:48,503
who I heard has already
tried to have me eliminated.

265
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,872
[Gasps]
He knows.

266
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,340
So what's it gonna be?

267
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:54,709
Her or me?

268
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,878
- Hey, Lauren.
- Oh!

269
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,513
Remember that thing I said
I wasn't gonna do?

270
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:00,682
It didn't go well.
Is that Owen?

271
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,816
Oh, yeah.

272
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,919
Fausta gave it to me
as a consolation prize.

273
00:09:03,986 --> 00:09:05,946
- Doesn't make it better.
- No, it makes it worse.

274
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,980
McBrian, your wife is asking for

275
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:12,924
to follow her in the divorce.

276
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:14,785
House, my car.

277
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:16,586
My military pension.

278
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:18,622
Seems like I might be
getting rooked here.

279
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:20,424
You're my lawyer.
What do you think?

280
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,392
[Sighs]
I think we gotta take it.

281
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,194
It's why I pay you
the big bucks.

282
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:26,129
Danny,
put down the pen!

283
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:27,564
Back off,
you Porsche-driving,

285
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:32,135
Harvard name-dropping
mother [Bleep]!

286
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:33,303
He has a new lawyer.

287
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,071
- You're gonna help me?
- Yeah.

288
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:36,440
You're so sweet.

289
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:38,241
Well... you can't let him
think that.

290
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:40,744
Now I have to...

291
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:42,345
[Clattering]

292
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:43,814
[Inhales deeply]

293
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:46,249
Balance restored.

294
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:47,417
Thanks for joining us.

295
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,085
Our topic today
is team chemistry

296
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:51,988
and how it can easily be
undermined.

297
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:53,190
Our guest, Terrell Owens.

298
00:09:53,257 --> 00:09:54,758
Terrell, so when you were
with the Cowboys...

299
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:56,293
I thought you brought me
here to apologize

300
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,880
for throwing fruit at me
the last time.

301
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:59,963
Right.
Sorry about that fruit thing.

302
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,097
So when you were
with the Cowboys,

303
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:02,532
they were
a Super Bowl contender, but...

304
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,034
That apology
didn't feel genuine.

305
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:05,502
I'm a person, Ryan.

306
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,490
Not a robot in, like,
those Schwarzenegger movies

307
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:09,072
you always talk about.

308
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,674
Okay,
well, we're gonna go

309
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:11,842
to the phones.

310
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:13,143
We've got John from Reseda.

311
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:14,945
Ryan, it's Simone.

312
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:17,214
I feel your impression of me
is way off base.

313
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:18,348
Been there, Simone.

314
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,017
I think you should give me
a chance, Ryan.

315
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:23,987
I spread awesomeness.
Let's go out one night.

316
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:25,956
We are not doing this
right now.

317
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:27,144
Oh, she's under your skin?

318
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:29,226
She sounds attractive.
Is she attractive?

319
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:30,560
You know what?
We gonna go to a commercial,

320
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:32,195
and we're gonna figure
this out off the air.

321
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,296
Thank you.

322
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,298
All right, Terrell.
We're done.

323
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:37,133
You need help.

324
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:40,303
What the...

325
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:43,573
Did you paint a picture
of me, man?

326
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:45,976
Hi.

327
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:47,577
You stay away from me.

328
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,312
- Look, you know me.
- No, I don't know.

329
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,081
And you know
I have a hard time

330
00:10:51,148 --> 00:10:52,983
saying I'm...
W-rong.

331
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,885
It's easy for me
to accept blame.

332
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:56,520
I just have
a cognitive problem

333
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:57,954
with my silent "W" s.

334
00:10:58,022 --> 00:10:59,256
It's weird,
I don't have any trouble

335
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:00,557
w-riting them.

336
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,225
I need to make amends.

337
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:06,997
I have brought you
this rare African grey parrot.

338
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,065
That's a pigeon.
[Pigeon coos]

339
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,200
I don't want your bird.

340
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:12,302
But I have to make
things right.

341
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,504
I slapped you,
I flipped your car,

342
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:16,406
I poured super glue
all over

343
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,174
your girlfriend's
computer keyboard.

344
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,309
Girlfriend?

345
00:11:19,377 --> 00:11:21,211
- Who did this?
- Stop.

346
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,746
Mr. K,
I'm not even mad at you.

347
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:24,381
I'm actually mad
at Ryan.

348
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:25,749
I kill myself
for the guy,

349
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:28,018
and he complains about me
behind my back.

350
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:29,519
He doesn't understand
the pressure I face

351
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:31,555
from ad sales,
from audience erosion...

352
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:32,822
You know, forget it.

353
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,890
I don't want to bore you
with the minutia

354
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:34,958
of the radio business.

355
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:36,226
No, no, no.

356
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:38,728
I love minutia.
Explain it all to me.

357
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:41,131
- Seriously?
- May I take notes?

358
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:43,667
No.
You don't have to do that.

359
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,201
Carrie, take this down.

360
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:48,204
[Laughter]

361
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:51,374
Danny, I asked you
to make

362
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,777
a list of everything
you wanted, and this is

363
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:55,145
what you've come up with?
Yeah.

364
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:58,448
The pullout sofa,
the wheelbarrow,

365
00:11:58,516 --> 00:11:59,950
the History Channel.

366
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,251
Just the History Channel?

367
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:02,352
Sorry.

368
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,821
I just got off the phone
with John Lithgow.

369
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:06,356
Harvard '67.

370
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:08,291
So...

371
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,960
Ready to sign off
on my client's demands?

372
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:11,394
This is
what's gonna happen.

373
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:12,996
My client will pay
no alimony,

374
00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:14,297
he'll retain his pension

375
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:15,966
and acquire half
of the joint assets.

376
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,701
If you want to take this
before a judge,

377
00:12:17,768 --> 00:12:19,803
I will you eat you
for lunch.

378
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,438
You're not
a divorce attorney.

379
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:23,373
This is my specialty.

380
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,474
Oh, yeah?

381
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:27,844
Well,
my specialty is winning.

382
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:30,280
And I can and will do
everything in my power

383
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:31,915
to get that jury
on my side.

384
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,750
Yeah, I can rile them up

385
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:35,652
over the injustice
that's been done.

386
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,787
Or I can make 'em laugh.

387
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,723
Or I can make 'em cry

388
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,224
over the betrayal

389
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:47,063
of a 1/64th Chinook Indian.

390
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:49,165
We stole his people's land.

391
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:51,635
She stole his family...

392
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:54,137
[Crying]
His dignity...

393
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:56,272
His heart.

394
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,481
Have your client sign
these papers now,

395
00:13:04,548 --> 00:13:05,682
or I do this for real.

396
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,083
[Chuckles]

397
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:10,687
Call John Lithgow.
Tell him you're [Bleep].

398
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:13,323
I know what
you're thinking.

399
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:15,625
What awesomeness can Simone
bring me here?

400
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:16,860
Just you wait.

401
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,296
Another round of drinks,
please, Charlene.

402
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:22,832
Ah, yes, the old clocking
of the name tag trick.

403
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,701
My mom does that.
Nobody wants it.

404
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,090
What if our connection
to Charlene

405
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:27,103
could change our lives?

406
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:28,371
There are no strangers...

407
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:30,140
Only friends
we haven't met yet.

408
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,809
Um... yuck.

409
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,311
Let's deepen our connection.
Truth or dare?

410
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,180
You realize
we're not 14 years old, right?

411
00:13:37,248 --> 00:13:38,815
- Truth or dare, dummy.
- Fine, truth.

412
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:41,317
Where'd you meet your wife?

413
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:45,388
My first radio job.

414
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,891
She was the daughter
of the station manager,

415
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:51,161
and he hated me,
and I asked Janie out.

416
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:53,463
And, I think just to spite him,
she said "yes."

417
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,165
I think that's why
she married me.

418
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:57,067
That and the fact that
I have a six-pack.

419
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:58,435
But in order to see it,
I have to breathe

420
00:13:58,502 --> 00:13:59,636
all the air out
of my body,

421
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:02,405
and then cough, like,
really hard.

422
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:04,207
- Truth or dare?
- Dare.

423
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,976
Okay.
You know Charlene's name.

424
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:08,378
Now get her phone number.

425
00:14:08,446 --> 00:14:09,686
Wow, Ryan,
that's the first dare

426
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:10,680
I've ever heard
that doesn't involve me

427
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:11,748
taking my clothes off.

428
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:12,916
Well, in fairness to me,

429
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:14,384
I didn't realize
that was an option.

430
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,619
Charlene,
we've had a great time,

431
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:17,727
and I don't want it
to end.

432
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:19,189
Why don't you give me
your number?

433
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:22,726
You won't be sorry.
I know how to do stuff.

434
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:24,861
[Scoffs]

435
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:29,065
I know how to do stuff too,
Charlene.

436
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,734
All right, that was good.
Nicely done.

437
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:32,321
Not surprised you picked
"dare" though.

438
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:34,204
You don't seem to be
that big a fan of truth.

439
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:35,431
Fine,
you want a free truth?

440
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:37,240
Okay.
Let's talk about your fiance.

441
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:38,842
The love of your life.

442
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:41,411
When's his birthday?
What's his favorite color?

443
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:42,779
Is he outraged
that the Monkees

444
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:44,748
are not in the rock and roll
hall of fame?

445
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:46,282
I don't know
any of those things.

446
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,917
I only knew him
for 24 hours.

447
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:50,019
Aha!
Tepid tragedy.

448
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:52,322
Does that mean that he wasn't
the love of my life?

449
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,090
How long did it
take for you

450
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:57,127
to fall for the love
of your life?

451
00:14:57,194 --> 00:14:58,194
Not long.

452
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:00,563
Ow.

453
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:01,898
There's a storm coming.

454
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:03,700
I can always feel it
in my dance leg.

455
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:05,301
Really?
You calling your shot

456
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:08,805
with a storm in L.A.?
Leg never lies.

457
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:10,473
Lady, you are either
the most interesting person

458
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:14,811
I've ever met
or a pathological liar.

459
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,247
I'll take truth.

460
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,282
What about me
makes you so crazy?

461
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,384
- You really want to know?
- Mm-hmm.

462
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,555
Okay,
the person that I was

463
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:28,424
closest to
in the world died.

464
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:30,960
And I try to keep it
all cool and together,

465
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:32,896
but most mornings,
it's a miracle

466
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:35,665
I can even get
out of bed.

467
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:38,201
And that group
really helps me.

468
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:41,004
I don't know how.
I don't know why.

469
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:45,008
But I don't want you
messing with that.

470
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:48,645
Come with me.

471
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:54,150
The viewable impressions
plus the roi should equal

472
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:55,919
advertising effectiveness.

473
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:58,555
But in a world
of time-shifted content,

474
00:15:58,622 --> 00:16:00,490
the older rules
no longer apply.

475
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:03,626
You are w-restling
with historic challenges.

476
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:05,628
[Laughs]
You get it!

477
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:07,163
You're the first person
that's ever

478
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:08,865
taken the time to understand.

479
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:10,033
Thanks, buddy.

480
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,434
Are we buddies?

481
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:14,070
- Can I call you buddy?
- Yeah, sure.

482
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:15,171
Oh, buddy.

483
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,807
This is the best moment
of my life, buddy.

484
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,509
Huh?
What now?

485
00:16:19,577 --> 00:16:22,579
Should we go pull a prank
on some lesser pair of buddies?

486
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,514
I would like
to teach Ryan

487
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:26,182
a lesson about taking me
for granted.

488
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,684
- Hey.
- Hey.

489
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:29,652
Are we talking about
teaching Ryan a lesson?

490
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,521
- Yeah.
- I'm in.

491
00:16:33,112 --> 00:16:34,646
Anne is a miracle worker.

492
00:16:34,713 --> 00:16:36,047
I basically get everything.

493
00:16:36,115 --> 00:16:38,916
So you're gonna be single.
That's exciting.

494
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:39,996
Hey.

495
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:42,131
Maybe you could
be my wingman.

496
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:43,366
Let me check something.

497
00:16:43,434 --> 00:16:45,401
Oh, yeah, yeah.

498
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:47,970
You wouldn't be
too much competition.

499
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:50,640
All I have to do is sign here,
and it is official.

500
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:52,008
Put down that pen, Danny.
We're gonna get more.

501
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:53,076
More?

502
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,270
The jewelry
that you gave her,

503
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:56,379
those savings bonds
from her grandparents.

504
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:59,215
The diaphragm that she got
using your health coverage.

505
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:00,283
I don't want a diaphragm.

506
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:01,918
Well, sell it.
Use it for a yarmulke.

507
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:03,453
We're getting it.

508
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,188
Don't you want her to suffer
for what she did to you?

509
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:07,123
No, I just want to
move on.

510
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:09,092
Danny,
the woman made a vow.

511
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:12,128
She promised to be there
through good times and bad,

512
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:13,830
by your side, forever.

513
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:16,799
She doesn't get to leave
because she gets bored,

514
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:18,434
or she finds someone new,

515
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:22,572
or she forgets to take
her damn heart medication!

516
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,243
You know, Anne,

517
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:29,745
it seems like you could start
talking about one woman,

518
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:33,316
but end up talking about...
Yeah, we're already there.

519
00:17:33,383 --> 00:17:35,284
This all feels very
<i>the wire.</i>

520
00:17:35,352 --> 00:17:37,487
Are we about to get "got"?
We don't get got.

521
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:39,555
I take you to a meet
so you get got or I get got,

522
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,324
but we don't both get got,
'cause it's not how it works.

523
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:42,692
Yeah, I don't actually
watch the show.

524
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,026
I know I'm supposed to.

525
00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:47,230
You asked me
why I took you here.

526
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:52,768
I sent you a poem that would be
perfect for this

527
00:17:52,836 --> 00:17:54,303
if you weren't
such a dude.

528
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:57,273
The world is full
of magical things,

529
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:59,375
patiently waiting
for our senses...

530
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:03,379
Both: To grow sharper.

531
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:07,216
- You did read it.
- Yeah.

532
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:11,020
[Thunderclap]

533
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:13,890
I told you.

534
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:16,292
Still think I'm full of it?

535
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:23,466
I'm not certain I care.

536
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:42,752
And it's pretty clear

537
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:45,188
you still have
a lot of anger towards Patty.

538
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:46,556
Of course I do.

539
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:47,790
If she really loved me,

540
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:49,659
she would have taken care
of herself.

541
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:51,394
You ought to cut her
some slack.

542
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:54,664
I got six grandchildren
I love.

543
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:57,500
But I still do things
that are bad for me.

544
00:18:57,568 --> 00:19:00,836
Hell, I'd drop "e" if somebody
would hook me up.

545
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:02,104
It's not happening, George.

546
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:03,739
I can't even sleep
in our bed

547
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,142
because it reminds me how
every night I would say,

548
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,710
"did you take your pill?"

549
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:10,079
She would kiss me,
lie to my face,

550
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:11,280
and say, "yes."

551
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:13,249
You have to let
that anger go.

552
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:14,517
[Exhales]

553
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:16,185
You know what allows me
not to hate Bonnie?

554
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:17,973
Blunt force trauma
to your prefrontal cortex

555
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:19,388
suffered during
basic training?

556
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:23,359
No. That just left me with
a few minor spatial issues.

557
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:24,994
With Bonnie, when something
she's done wrong

558
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:26,195
pops into my head,

559
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:27,797
I immediately think
of all the good times

560
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:29,799
we had together.

561
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:31,701
Do you think you can
try sleeping

562
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:32,768
in your own bed tonight?

563
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:35,438
I don't know
if I'm ready.

564
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:41,644
Here. It's right here.

565
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:43,846
You know, you said
you would be here for me.

566
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:46,749
I didn't think
you were being literal.

567
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:50,052
This group does not do well
with metaphors.

568
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Plus,
we made you

569
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:52,622
a first-night-in-your-bed
cake.

570
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:54,323
This cake
is delicious, Fausta.

571
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:55,391
My secret:

572
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:57,126
I use an extra cup
of Brown sugar

573
00:19:57,194 --> 00:19:59,629
and breast milk.

574
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:00,796
Okay, you know what?

575
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:02,498
I've changed my mind.

576
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:03,733
I don't think I can do this
tonight.

577
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,601
Wait.
You can do it, Anne.

578
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:08,537
Think about the good times.

579
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:11,274
You're right.

580
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:14,176
Thank you, guys.

Oh, no!
Straight sex!

584
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:24,186
This is a very big step
for me.

585
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:25,254
Why here?

586
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:26,522
We were saying good night.

587
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,657
One thing led to another.

588
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:29,292

Please.

591
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:34,764
Let's talk about
how we're all feeling.

592
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:36,932
We're listening.

593
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,102
I'm glad I could experience
this night with you.

594
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,005
And several members
of the group.

595
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:44,940
I could have done without
Fausta saying,

596
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:46,409
"I got next."

597
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:47,977
Did she mean me or you?

598
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:50,146
Me.
You get Anne.

599
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:52,148
Fausta's mine.

600
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:57,286
Good night.
