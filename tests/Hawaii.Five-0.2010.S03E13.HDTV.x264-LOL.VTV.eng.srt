00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:32,398
Look... I came to you

183
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,284
because we're friends,

184
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:37,086
'cause I trust you.

185
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:39,672
I'm gonna need your help
cloning that phone.

186
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:49,349
It's a mobile data extractor.

187
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:51,267
It has a built-in
SIM card reader

188
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:52,936
and creates a cloned phone.

189
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:56,940
Sure you want to do this?

190
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,312
Look, I know you weren't in
this cell block last night,

191
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:04,280
but how the hell did
someone sneak you in?

192
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:05,698
I don't know.
Two guys drugged me.

193
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,450
Next thing I know,
I wake up in here.

194
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:08,818
Food service truck
makes night deliveries.

195
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,104
That's the only way you
could've gotten in here.

196
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,411
Tell me about the
two guys. Who are they?

197
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:13,240
I don't know.

198
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:15,158
Just get me to Warden Grier,
and I'll prove I'm a cop.

199
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,912
Well, if you are, Halawa's
the last place you want to be.

200
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:21,714
Cops that serve time in here
don't do too well.

201
00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:26,753
It's okay. It's a shortcut.
It's empty.

202
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:28,287
Inmates are at first meal.

203
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,506
Come on.

204
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:37,146
What are you doing?!
Open the door!

205
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:39,849
Open the door!
(man whistles)

206
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:42,301
Lieutenant Kelly.

207
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:56,082
Kaleo.

208
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:57,700
Warrick told me

209
00:12:57,702 --> 00:13:00,086
an old friend was
sending me a surprise.

210
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:05,091
Didn't expect it to be one of
the dirty cops who locked me up.

211
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:06,993
You're the dirty cop.

212
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,661
Good men died because of you.

213
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,597
You belong here.

214
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,015
I don't.

215
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:14,801
Well, you're here now.

216
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:16,335
Who put me in here?

217
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,722
Somebody who wants you
to suffer before you die.

218
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:24,027
(grunting)

219
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:50,136
(screams)

220
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:54,724
(screaming)

221
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:05,184
(groaning)

222
00:14:05,186 --> 00:14:07,103
You must have been

223
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:09,606
a bad boy to end up
in here, Lieutenant.

224
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:13,242
I didn't...
I didn't do anything.

225
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:16,613
Yeah, that's what we all say.

226
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:29,294
I heard what
you told Kaleo.

227
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:31,079
Sounds like whoever
locked you up

228
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,247
is looking
to even the score.

229
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:33,882
Probably somebody
you put away.

230
00:14:35,718 --> 00:14:38,553
I've been a cop a long time.

231
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:42,557
I put a lot of people away.

232
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,095
But I'm betting... Warrick
knows who's behind this.

233
00:14:47,097 --> 00:14:48,396
Hey.

234
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:50,315
Lieutenant, whoever put you
in here doesn't matter.

235
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:53,268
All that matters is,
we got to get you out.

236
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:59,024
And why should I trust you?

237
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:01,743
How about 'cause I just saved
your sorry ass from Kaleo?

238
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:03,612
Also, Five-O
brought me

239
00:15:03,614 --> 00:15:06,331
to this island and put me up
in this classy joint

240
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,166
so I could be
closer to my kid.

241
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,618
I owe you.

242
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:13,004
Oh, and there's,
uh, one more thing.

243
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,294
Why the hell
did you do that?

244
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:20,629
The first time we met,

245
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,881
you hit me across the
face with an ashtray.

246
00:15:22,883 --> 00:15:25,884
Now that we're even,
you can trust me.

247
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,354
We good?

248
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:32,274
We're good.

249
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,681
Warrick runs
Max Security.

250
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:40,899
His keys only
work in A-Block.

251
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:41,900
Yeah?

252
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:43,151
I got to get word to a guard

253
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:45,036
outside this cell block,
let him know I'm a cop.

254
00:15:45,038 --> 00:15:47,739
Seriously? 'Cause that worked
out so well for you last time.

255
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:49,374
Look, you don't know

256
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:51,326
which guards were paid off--
not a good plan.

257
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:52,661
We keep moving this way.

258
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:58,083
All right,
what's your plan?

259
00:15:58,085 --> 00:15:59,501
Take the guards
out of the equation.

260
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:00,585
How you gonna do that?

261
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:03,889
Bring help
from the outside in.

262
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,726
Look, what we got to do

263
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:10,011
is find a phone and get
a call out to McGarrett.

264
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:11,263
There's cons, guards
and cameras everywhere.

265
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:12,647
You won't reach a phone.

266
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:13,815
Besides,
you're running out of time.

267
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:15,550
They'll be back
from chow any minute.

268
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:17,402
Starting a fire
is not going to work.

269
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:20,272
That's the problem
with cops-- too analytical.

270
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:21,673
You got to think
outside the box.

271
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:23,358
Halawa is not equipped
to deal with fires

272
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,609
if they're big enough.

273
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:26,778
They'll have to call HFD
to fight the blaze,

274
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,446
and when the first
responders come in,

275
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:30,749
you tell them you're Five-O.

276
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:34,870
Look, Lieutenant, you have
a better idea, speak up,

277
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:37,038
but the way I see it,
right now, this is

278
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,673
the only choice
you got.

279
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:40,759
So bust a move, huh?

280
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:44,095
♪

281
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:55,857
So, what, after I'm gone,

282
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:57,442
you're just
going to go back

283
00:16:57,444 --> 00:16:58,860
to sitting in a cell?

284
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,599
Come on, brah.

285
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:06,818
I know you work
the angle.

286
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,237
Why you really helping me?

287
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,742
Okay, truth.

288
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:15,627
Five-O's got the governor's ear.

289
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:17,212
I figure, I help you,

290
00:17:17,214 --> 00:17:19,464
maybe I'm out in six months
instead of six years.

291
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,283
Snitches don't last long in Max.

292
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:24,135
You know that.

293
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:26,054
I got to get out of here.

294
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,599
Time to send up
a smoke signal, huh?

295
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,905
Ah!

296
00:17:43,907 --> 00:17:46,107
That's smooth, baby.

297
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:50,779
(alarm blaring)

298
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:52,030
Hear that?

299
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:53,598
That's the sound
of freedom.

300
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:04,209
Hey.

301
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:07,595
What's going on?

302
00:18:07,597 --> 00:18:08,630
Uh, Steve, this is

303
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:10,515
Dr. Harriet Palmer.

304
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:12,183
She's the HPD
grief counselor.

305
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:13,435
She's here about Chin.
Hi.

306
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:15,503
Commander McGarrett,
I feel terrible coming here.

307
00:18:15,505 --> 00:18:18,673
I have never betrayed
my patient's confidence before,

308
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:19,975
but I'm worried about Chin Ho.

309
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:21,776
Um, Chin's your patient?

310
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:23,445
For the past few months.

311
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,064
I had no idea

312
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:27,482
he was seeing
a therapist.

313
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:30,184
He didn't want you to see his
grief as a sign of weakness.

314
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:31,903
(sighs)

315
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:33,371
What can we do to help?

316
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:34,906
That's the thing--
she's, uh...

317
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:36,624
she's concerned 'cause Chin had
an appointment today

318
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:37,709
and he didn't show up.

319
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,294
Well, Chin's on
the North Shore.

320
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:41,329
But he called me last night
to confirm his session.

321
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:43,197
I've been trying to reach him,
but he hasn't answered

322
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:44,549
or returned
my calls.

323
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:47,002
Hey, Chin's not
on the North Shore.

324
00:18:47,004 --> 00:18:49,170
I just called the hotel
that he usually stays at,

325
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:50,055
and he never checked in,

326
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:51,372
so I PING'd
his cell,

327
00:18:51,374 --> 00:18:52,707
and it's at his house.

328
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:57,679
Hey, Chin, buddy, you here?

329
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:04,052
KONO:
Chin... Chin.

330
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:07,439
Hey, he didn't go
to the North Shore.

331
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:10,191
His bike and his car
are both still in the garage.

332
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:29,177
Bed's unmade.

333
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:30,995
Chin stayed here
last night.

334
00:19:31,764 --> 00:19:34,749
Steve... Chin
wouldn't leave

335
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,434
anywhere
without his cell.

336
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,586
DANNY:
Hey, over here!

337
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:40,438
All right, back door was open.

338
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,940
Someone jimmied the lock,
let themselves in.

339
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:42,941
I'm thinking

340
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:44,759
Chin was asleep, two
intruders come in.

341
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:48,146
One of them uses that towel
to muffle the beeping keypad,

342
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:50,949
other guy comes over here,
disconnects the alarm.

343
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:53,234
And cuts the phone line
so the alarm company

344
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:55,236
never gets the call.
These guys were pros.

345
00:19:55,238 --> 00:19:57,772
Okay, they also left
his keys and his wallet.

346
00:19:57,774 --> 00:19:59,791
This wasn't a robbery.
No, it wasn't a robbery.

347
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:03,111
They didn't want money;
they wanted Chin.

348
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:09,667
All right, back door
was opened at 10:43.

349
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:11,786
Chin texted me
at 12:15.

350
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:13,638
No, Chin didn't
send you anything.

351
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,557
It was the kidnappers who
obviously sent that text.

352
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,792
Okay, I'll call CSU, get 'em
down here, process this place,

353
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:19,627
and I'll see if Fong can lift
a print off Chin's cell.

354
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:20,628
STEVE:
All right.

355
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,397
Okay,

356
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,265

You see that, Officer?

526
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:26,180
Delano, can't talk right now.
We're in lockdown.

00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:28,816
But it's done.

They're getting closer.

533

CHIN:
All right.

534
00:28:47,236 --> 00:28:48,836
Go get the door open.

535
00:28:48,838 --> 00:28:51,088
We'll try and
hold 'em off.

536
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:58,546
Come on.

537
00:29:03,468 --> 00:29:04,935
(gasps)

538
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:09,690
Good to see you
again, Lieutenant.

539
00:29:10,892 --> 00:29:12,960
Come on, let's go.

540
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:14,228
(Leilani gasps, groans)

541
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,680
LEILANI:
No!

542
00:29:17,249 --> 00:29:18,482
(whistles)

543
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:20,868
I found him.
The cop's down here.

544
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:23,904
(grunts)
What are you doing?

545
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:25,373
It's about survival.

546
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,991
If Kaleo finds out
I've been helping you,

547
00:29:26,993 --> 00:29:28,209
we're both dead.

548
00:29:28,211 --> 00:29:30,878
I knew I couldn't trust you.

549
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:35,800
(grunting,
loud, distant shouting)

550
00:29:37,302 --> 00:29:39,637
Back off! Back off!

551
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:41,138
Bring him to Kaleo alive.

552
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,307
Go! Go!

553
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:47,878
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

554
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,897
(siren whoops)

555
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:51,599
Yo.

556
00:29:51,601 --> 00:29:53,517
MAN: Steve.
How bad is it?

557
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,903
The inmates have taken control
of the Maximum Security.

558
00:29:55,905 --> 00:29:57,571
Whole place is still
on lockdown.

559
00:29:57,573 --> 00:29:59,407
Warden's not
letting anyone in.

560
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:00,741
Did you find Chin yet?

561
00:30:00,743 --> 00:30:02,076
Surveillance tapes
from earlier today

562
00:30:02,078 --> 00:30:03,227
prove he's inside.

563
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:04,412
We just can't get a lock where.

564
00:30:04,414 --> 00:30:06,063
Warden Grier.

565
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:09,450
Warden Grier, one of
my men is inside.

566
00:30:09,452 --> 00:30:10,668
I just found out, Commander.

567
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,002
We're doing everything we can,

568
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:15,122
but I have a riot on my hands,
and I have a protocol.

569
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:17,408
You have a protocol?
Where was your protocol

570
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,427
when Lieutenant Kelly
was locked in your prison?

571
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:21,245
Guards under
your supervision

572
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:23,297
conspired to do this.
This happened on your watch.

573
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:26,016
What's your plan of action
to get my man out of there?

574
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:28,769
A dozen of my men
are unaccounted for.

575
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:30,438
Some injured,
some worse.

576
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,773
I won't risk
any more lives.

577
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:35,526
Lieutenant Kelly's
on his own.

578
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:37,928
We're going in now.

579
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:47,196
(tires squealing)

580
00:30:52,385 --> 00:30:55,837
Got my bird all warmed
up for you, sistah.

581
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:58,592
Why's SWAT not taking
care of business?

582
00:30:58,594 --> 00:31:00,861
They got a whole flock
of choppers ready to go.

583
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:02,696
'Cause the warden won't let
anything up in the air

584
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:04,732
over Halawa
till he gives the go-ahead.

585
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:07,585
And we're not waiting
for permission.

586
00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:17,110
Hey, I got 62 more
payments on this girl.

587
00:31:17,112 --> 00:31:19,380
Be gentle, please!

588
00:31:19,382 --> 00:31:21,499
You may want to step back.

589
00:31:40,685 --> 00:31:42,887
(prisoners shouting)

590
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:16,887
You and me-- we've
had our issues.

591
00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:20,507
But bringing you this cop means
we're all good, you feel me?

592
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:24,028
Sure. I feel you.

593
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:29,950
Lieutenant.

594
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,321

to finish what we started.

little more painful,

599

when you can't hide
behind the badge and gun.

600
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:46,951
(grunts)

601
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:50,254
You're not better
than us.

602
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,675
You're one of us.

603
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:57,361
You belong here.

604
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:02,066
You turned on other cops,

605
00:33:02,068 --> 00:33:04,985
locked me up.

606
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,522
I only survived
because of one man--

607
00:33:08,524 --> 00:33:10,608
Frank Delano.

608
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,611
The man you killed.

609
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:15,496
Delano...

610
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:17,414
murdered my wife.

611
00:33:17,416 --> 00:33:18,832
He would've
killed my cousin

612
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:21,085
and me, too,
if he had the chance.

613
00:33:21,087 --> 00:33:24,237
His brother...
don't see it that way.

614
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:27,675
He put me in here.

615
00:33:27,677 --> 00:33:30,594
And now you die.

616
00:33:32,013 --> 00:33:32,947
Kaleo!

617
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:34,248
You're making
a mistake.

618
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,653
Why do you care
what happens to him?

619
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:36,685
I don't.

620
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:38,052

ain't just some cop.

622
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:41,438
He's Five-O.

623
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:44,358
Sure, you kill him,
you get a few seconds

624
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,695
of satisfaction--
but this man's your leverage.

625
00:33:47,697 --> 00:33:50,614
You keep him alive
a little while longer...

626
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:55,152

a ticket out of here.

they're willing

to trade for him.

633
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,451
On second thought...

634
00:34:11,453 --> 00:34:14,621
