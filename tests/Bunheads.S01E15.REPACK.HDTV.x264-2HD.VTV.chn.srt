00:00:00,-90 --> 00:00:01,660
《心舞》前情提要
Previously on Bunheads...

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,260
你父親有一位特別伴侶
Your father has a special someone.

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,800
我們得在這里賺點錢
We gotta make money off this place.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,600
-怎么賺  -建一座劇院
- By doing what? - What about...

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,640
怎么樣
a theater?

6
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,590
出柜了啊
The closet door opened.

7
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,110
他說他要搬到圣何塞
He says he's moving to San Jose;

8
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,610
她則說要搬到恩西諾市
she says she's moving to Encino.

9
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,940
我得選擇我要跟誰生活
I'm supposed to pick where I wanna go.

10
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,980
我們要建一座露天劇院
We're building an amphitheater.

11
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,500
現在我開始感興趣了
Now this I'm interested in.

12
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,940
-真的嗎  -成為露天劇場的合伙人
- You're interested in? - Partnering.

13
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,870
-誰給你買的花盆  -你在這兒干嘛
- Who gave you flowerpots? - What are you doing here?

14
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,150
這是我哥史考特  史考特  這是戈多
This is my brother Scotty. Scotty, this is Godot.

15
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,280
你好  年輕人
Well hello, young man.

16
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,980
順便說一下  薩莎也翹課了
Sasha's awol too by the way.

17
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,150
我知道她在哪里
Well, I know where she is.

18
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,700
她在找公寓  并且已經找到一間了
Apartment hunting. And she found one.

19
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,170
好了  女生們
All right, ladies.

20
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,970
保持輕盈  注意間距
Keep it light, watch your spacing.

21
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,770
舞步整齊
Dance as one.

22
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,600
我在考慮留劉海
I'm thinking of getting bangs.

23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,520
真的嗎
Oh yeah?

24
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,890
改變一下形象  你覺得如何
Something different. What do you think?

25
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,360
你想要做點改變嗎
You need a change?

26
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,270
是啊
Well, yeah.

27
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,430
難道你的生活很無聊
Your life is boring?

28
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,350
-金妮  -而且你的朋友也很無聊
- Ginny-- - Your friends are boring?

29
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,390
天啊
Oh boy.

30
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,120
新生活  新朋友
New life, new friends,

31
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,250
新劉海
New bangs.

32
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,260
女生們  多動腳  少動嘴
Moving the feet, not the mouths, ladies.

33
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,090
金妮  拜托  別再提柯澤特了
Ginny please, get over this Cozette thing.

34
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,060
對不起  沒和你說我去練輪滑
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about roller derby,

35
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,160
但我也沒告訴其他人
but I didn't tell anyone.

36
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,180
既沒告訴我爸媽  也沒告訴我哥哥
Not my parents or my brother.

37
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,250
你哥哥
Your brother?

38
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,880
-我是說...  -你沒告訴查理嗎
- I just mean-- - You didn't tell Charlie?

39
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,190
可是你和他那么的親密
But you're so close with him.

40
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,380
你什么都對查理講
You tell Charlie everything.

41
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,900
-我只是...  -我不知道你沒告訴查理
- I was just-- - I didn't know you didn't tell Charlie.

42
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,460
如果你沒告訴查理
If you didn't tell Charlie,

43
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,840
很顯然  是我反應過度了
then clearly, I'm overreacting.

44
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,030
是這樣嗎
Aren't I?

45
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,820
我反應過度了嗎
Aren't I overreacting?

46
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,020
波  沒有正確答案的
There's no good answer, Boo.

47
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,290
比方說你的閨蜜  在你不知情的情況下
Say your best friend suddenly had a secret life

48
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,590
有了全新的生活
that you didn't know about.

49
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,500
你發現后
When you found out,

50
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,460
會感到憤怒  覺得被背叛嗎
would you feel mad, betrayed?

51
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,020
就像是你最好的朋友
Like maybe your best friend wasn't actually

52
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,060
根本不是你最好的朋友
your best friend at all?

53
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,640
-好吧  -或者...
- Well-- - Or...

54
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,320
一旦你發現她也沒有告訴她哥哥
once you found out she didn't tell her brother either,

55
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,180
你會舒服點  然后對此釋懷嗎
would you feel fine and forget it ever happened?

56
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,510
-我不懂你的意思  -什么
- I missed you. - What?

57
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,890
默默不語的雙唇才是動人的雙唇
A closed mouth is a pretty mouth.

58
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,650
-對不起  -隨便吧
- Sorry. - Whatever.

59
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,100
我就和她說過兩次話
I talked to her twice.

60
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,250
并不代表我們就是最好的朋友
It's not like we're best friends.

61
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,530
-她給你取了外號  -拜托
- She named you. - Come on.

62
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,180
無敵破壞王克里奧
Cleo-Smacktra?

63
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,970
她得耗費了多少心力
How many seconds of thought

64
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,500
才能想出來啊
did she put into that one?

65
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,580
你們又吵架啦
Are you guys fighting again?

66
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,050
不知道  關于這段關系
I don't know. I am the last one

67
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,570
我是唯一一個被蒙在鼓里的
to know anything in this relationship.

68
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,060
難以置信  我只不過離開了五分鐘
Unbelievable. I turn my back for five minutes.

69
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,740
柯澤特和我只是碰巧在旱冰場遇到
Cozette just happened to be at the rink when I was there.

70
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,870
我又沒有打電話給她  然后說
It's not like I called her up and said

71
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,370
"我要告訴你所有的秘密  柯澤特"
"I'll tell you all my secrets, Cozette."

72
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,440
我不想再聽到任何"柯"的諧音
I don't want to hear the c-word anymore.

73
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,250
當然  科澤特就在我右邊
Of course, right to Cozette.

74
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,320
那是舞蹈編排而已
That's the choreography.

75
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,130
她也許向范妮夫人施了魔法
She probably cast some kind of spell on Madame Fanny

76
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,710
把編舞弄成這樣
to make it happen like that.

77
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,250
柯澤特無所不能  柯澤特是女巫
Cozette can do anything. Cozette's a wizard.

78
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,130
我以為你不想聽到任何"柯"的諧音
I thought you didn't want to hear the c-word?

79
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,890
我對金妮的事感到抱歉
I'm sorry about Ginny.

80
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,540
我愛她  但是她太頑固了
I love her, but she's stubborn.

81
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,670
給她點時間吧
Just give her time.

82
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,400
你沒做錯任何事
You didn't do anything wrong.

83
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,580
誰是金妮
Who's Ginny?

84
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,410
她有魔力  又完美
She's magic and perfect,

85
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,210
從大眾眼光看  她還無比時髦
and worldly, and so so hip.

86
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,320
倫敦的一條街道  以時裝出名

87
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,320
她就是穿著芭蕾舞鞋的卡納比街
She's Carnaby Street in pointe shoes.

88
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,330
我們什么時候見過柯澤特啦
When did we even meet Cozette?

89
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,530
我就是柯澤特
I'm Cozette.

90
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,870
多么精彩的初次彩排啊
What a wonderful first try.

91
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,210
它讓我想起我青年時光
It reminds me of a time

92
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,670
芭蕾舞劇  許多芭蕾舞團的保留劇目

93
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,670
那時我在《仙女們》擔任獨舞演員
when I was a young soloist in "Les Sylphides"

94
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,980
我和一位舞者大吵一架
and I was having a terrible fight

95
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,180
她扮演了一位仙女...
with a nymph--

96
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,490
更貼切的說  是仙女花癡
or a nympho, which is a more accurate description

97
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,610
這也是我們吵架的真正原因
and the actual reason for our fight.

98
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,820
總之  彩排過程中我們破口大罵
Anyhow we wound up having words during rehearsal.

99
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,370
你們知道后來怎么樣了嗎
And do you know what happened?

100
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,830
首演當晚  我們只能在大廳的貨攤邊
We both watched opening night

101
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,460
看別人表演
from the concession stand in the lobby.

102
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,990
請記住這一點...
So with that in mind...

103
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,910
心 舞
第一季第15集

104
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,130
我忘記了
Oh, I forgot.

105
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,460
我帶了購物袋
I brought my own bags.

106
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,480
別磨蹭了
Let's go.

107
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,600
你開什么玩笑
You've got to be kidding.

108
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,450
-你們能再開個收款通道嗎  -拜托
- Could you guys open up another register? - Come on!

109
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,530
快點啊
Come on.

110
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,140
那就是舞臺
And that's the stage

111
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,870
米利森特·斯通藝術表演中心即將落成

112
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,110
周圍會擺滿座位
with seating all around.

113
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,130
我們還打算在樹上
Oh, and we're going to hang lanterns

114
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,560
掛滿燈籠
in all the trees.

115
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,970
演出前它們會被點亮
They'll be dimmed before the performances.

116
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,610
很漂亮  不是說你  索爾
Pretty. No, not you, Saul.

117
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,030
我怎么會說你漂亮呢
Why would I call you pretty?

118
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,690
希望舞臺夠大
I hope the stage is big enough.

119
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,950
你覺得舞臺夠大了嗎
Do you think the stage is big enough?

120
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,460
針對中場秀還是...
For the halftime show, or?

121
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,460
美國超級碗的中場表演  場面盛大

122
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,710
你說得對  說得對  當我沒問
You're right. You're right. It's fine.

123
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,260
如果你想要更大的舞臺
Whoa, hey. If you need a bigger stage,

124
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,440
那我們就做一個唄
let's make a bigger stage.

125
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,770
他們遲交兩周的房租了
They're two weeks late on rent.

126
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,780
找個會說立陶宛語的無賴
Go find someone that speaks Lithuanian deadbeat

127
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,740
把他們趕出去
and tell them to get out.

128
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,520
-我好激動啊  -我知道
- I am so excited. - I know.

129
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,480
你討厭我身上的這件上衣
I'm wearing that shirt you hate

130
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,770
你竟然沒問我是怎樣卑躬屈膝才買到它
and you haven't asked me what bum I had to roll to get it yet.

131
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,360
你們覺得舞臺怎樣
What do you girls think of the stage?

132
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,590
太酷了
It's really cool.

133
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,410
我還沒在戶外跳過舞呢
I've never danced outside before.

134
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,970
如果想要更大的舞臺
If the stage is gonna be bigger,

135
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,730
我們得跟胖子鮑勃和瘦子唐說說
we have to tell fat Bob and skinny Don.

136
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,160
我跟他們發誓說一切就緒了
And I swore to them that we'd finalized everything.

137
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,810
他們不會開心的
This will not make them happy.

138
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,060
女士  我們不是來討他們歡心的
Ladies, we are not here to make them happy.

139
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,740
這是為了我們和那些孩子
This is for us and the kids.

140
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,820
嘿  胖子鮑勃和瘦子唐
Hey! Fat Bob and skinny Don.

141
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,440
我們一般不當著他們的面叫他們綽號
Oh, we don't usually call them that to their face.

142
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,410
-有問題嗎  -我們想擴建舞臺
- Is something wrong? - We want to make the stage bigger.

143
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,720
他們想擴建舞臺
They want to make the stage bigger.

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,850
我們已經訂好了木材
We already ordered the wood.

145
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,760
上周就訂了
Last week.

146
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,090
打了電話  開了支票
Made the call, wrote the check.

147
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,210
你能再多訂點嗎
Well, can you order more,

148
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,330
還是說木頭被你們訂光了
or is that the last wood in the world?

149
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,770
是啊  這個諷刺可不夠高明
Uh, yeah, the sarcasm has not gone unnoticed.

150
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,210
但你得知道  這么做會拖慢進度
But see, now, there's gonna be some lag time.

根據狄更斯的小說《霧都孤兒》改編而成的音樂劇

202
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,640

但它毀了我的

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,580
每個耶穌受難像都要釘三個釘子

反正一切開銷由她支付
As long as the lady's paying for it,

244
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,130
為什么不用駱馬毛服裝呢

得了吧  史考特  告訴我你要干嘛

直到我們睡著  等我們醒了

-確實沒有發生過  -風揚起
- I'm afraid not. - The wind kicked up

301
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,770
我們握著綢帶  乘著熱氣球
and we held the ribbons and we rode on them?

302
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,380
-沒有熱氣球嗎  -她騙我們的
- No balloons? - She gaslighted us, dude.

303
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,420
這是我第二喜歡的童年記憶
That was my second favorite childhood memory.

304
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,720
唐·麥克林沒在你十五歲的生日派對上表演
Don Mclean didn't play your fifth birthday party.

305
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,720
美國游吟歌手

306
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,250
你自己靜一下吧
I'll give you some space.

307
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,140
我剛搬進去  需要電啟動電器
I just moved in so I need to get the power turned on.

308
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,110
明天就能來電  很好
By tomorrow would be great actually.

309
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,020
信用卡  我有
A credit card? Well, I do.

310
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,320
其實是我父母的
I mean, it's technically my parents',

311
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,150
不過在商店里可以刷  所以...
But they take it at the mall, so...

312
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,510
我們能跳過存款這塊嗎
Can we just skip the deposit?

313
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,870
我很有責任心
I'm very responsible.

314
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,890
這是真的  她從未醉過或懷孕過
It's true. She's never been drunk or pregnant.

315
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,760
我能用現金結算嗎
Look, can I just give you cash?

316
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,370
我想自動取款機
Oh. I don't think the ATM

317
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,790
不會讓我一次取那么多錢
will give me that much.

318
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,320
真的嗎
Really?

319
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,890
我以前從未去過銀行
Wow, I've never actually gone inside a bank before.

320
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,540
是的  這將是一次冒險
Yes. It will be an adventure.

321
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,590
謝謝
Thank you.

322
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,170
有人知道哪兒有銀行嗎
Anyone know where a bank is?

323
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,500
這么多的待辦事項
That is a very long to-do list.

324
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,320
電視  電話  網絡  供電...
Cable, phone, internet, electricity...

325
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,520
-煤氣呢  -怎么了
- What about gas? - What about it?

326
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,880
你的熱水器是電熱的還是煤氣的
Is your water heater electric or gas?

327
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,960
-我不知道  -很可能是煤氣的
- I have no idea. - It's probably gas.

328
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,020
打電話給煤氣公司
Calling the gas company.

329
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,640
工程浩大啊
This is a lot of work.

330
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,410
但超值的  公寓太棒了
But it's worth it. The apartment is awesome.

331
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,820
就需要一點小裝修
I mean, it needed a little jeuje.

332
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,200
刷刷棳  裝個新水槽
A paint job, new sink,

333
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,630
我撤掉了地毯
I'm pulling up the carpets.

334
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,480
那些裝了硬木地板又鋪地毯的人
People who cover up their hardwood floors

335
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,880
一定活在裝修地獄里
deserve their own poorly decorated section of hell.

336
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,490
你看起來真像大人
Wow, you seem so grown up.

337
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,510
我是不是把舞袋留在你媽媽的車里了
Hey, did I leave my dance bag in your mom's car?

338
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,590
我不知道  有人可能知道哦
I don't know. You know who would know?

339
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,200
-她怎么會知道  -她對你了如指掌
- How would she know? - She knows everything about you.

340
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
我想她可以用"梅蘭妮尋回系統"
I figure she can use her Melanie LoJack System

341
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,200
徹底掌控某位傻瓜
and track that sucker right down.

342
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,680
這個  給你
Oh, here. For you,

343
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,120
給你  還有你
and you, and you.

344
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,750
-這是什么  -我正式邀請你們
- What's this? - I am officially inviting you

345
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,170
來參加我的喬遷派對
to my housewarming party.

346
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,080
抱歉  這么晚才給你們  不過我想
Sorry it's so last minute, but I thought heat and light

347
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,930
暖氣和燈光會讓聚會更歡樂的
would make it more festive.

348
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,190
我可以帶卡爾去嗎
Would it be okay if I bring Carl?

349
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,720
不行  都不準帶伴兒
No. No one brings anyone.

350
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,190
就我們四個
It's just the four of us.

351
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,460
不僅如此  我還邀請了其他人
Yes, and all the other people I'm inviting.

352
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,970
誰  你請了誰
Who? Who are you inviting?

353
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,030
淡定  班上的幾個女孩子
Well, freak, some girls from class,

354
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,570
米歇爾  我喜歡的三位同學
Michelle, the three people I like at school,

355
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,150
以及我的鄰居
and my neighbors

356
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,710
這樣他們就不會抱怨我們太吵了
so they can't complain about the noise.

357
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,000
你邀請科澤特了嗎
Are you inviting Cozette?

358
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,170
她和我們一起上課啊
Well, she's in our class.

359
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,590
-她來的話  就別算上我  -真的嗎
- If she comes, count me out. - Seriously?

360
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,900
-金妮  別這樣  -別怎樣
- Ginny, come on. - What come on?

361
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,110
四人成群  五人擁擠
Four's company. Five's a crowd.

362
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,650
好吧  如果金妮不去  我也不去
Fine. If Ginny's not going, I'm not going.

363
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,220
-你沒必要這樣做  -我樂意
- You don't have to do that. - I want to.

364
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,430
希望不是因為我
It's not on my account, I hope.

365
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,610
當然是因為你
Of course it's on your account.

366
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,850
-那就去啊  去  -不去
- Then go. Yes. - No.

367
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,590
我的天啊

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,370
我們還沒正式做過自我介紹  我是薩莎
We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Sasha.

369
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,200
我本來打算邀請你
I was planning on inviting you

370
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,760
參加我的喬遷派對
to a housewarming party I'm having

371
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,820
互相了解一下對方
so we can get to know each other,

372
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,190
不過我那幾個朋友們
but my friends over there are re-enacting

373
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,260
正在重新演繹《返老還童》的后三分之一
the last third of "Benjamin Button"

374
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,610
馬上就演到四歲那部分了
and will soon turn four.

375
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,260
所以我們改天
So would it be okay if we just grabbed

376
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,670
去喝杯咖啡好嗎
a coffee sometime instead?

377
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,830
-酷斃  -我當你同意了
- Cool beans. - I'm interpreting that as a yes.

So, thank you.

379
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,390
科澤特不去  行了嗎

為今晚休戰好嗎
Truce for the evening?

383
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,500
很好
Good.

384
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,010
那我帶卡爾去行嗎
So, do I get to bring Carl?

385
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,680
這是在沙漠舉辦的年度盛事
It's an annual event in the desert

386
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,960
慶祝自我表達的實現
that is a celebration of self-expression.

387
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,580
是嗎  有提到洗手間怎么樣嗎
Yeah, but what does it say about bathrooms?

388
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,400
看看這些圖片  天吶  太美了
Oh, look at these pictures. My god, it's beautiful.

389
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,690
好好好  有洗手間的圖片嗎
Yeah yeah yeah. Is there a picture of the bathrooms?

390
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,700
"公共生活實驗"
"An experiment in communal living."

391
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,460
我也做過  最終一條干凈毛巾都不剩
I've done that before. You wind up never having a clean towel.

392
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,580
那是什么
Ooh, what's that over there?

393
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,690
-一塊石頭  -我還以為是洗手間
- A rock. - Oh, I thought it was a bathroom.

394
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,520
你打算吃一堆路邊攤垃圾食品
Are you planning on eating a great deal of roadside food

395
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,090
然后一到那兒就開始翻江倒海嗎
and having some terrible reaction once you get there?

396
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,460
我只是害怕遠離洗手間  好嗎
I just have a thing about bathrooms, okay?

397
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,760
在方圓十英里內至少得有一個
I want one within a good 10-mile radius.

398
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,160
你是藝術家  得開放心態擁抱新事物
You're an artist. You need to be open to new things.

399
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,800
這就是我對伍德斯托克音樂節的感覺
That's how I felt about Woodstock.

400
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,050
你參加過伍德斯托克音樂節
You went to Woodstock?

401
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,790
我一開始不想去的
I didn't want to at first.

402
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,970
但這成為了我一輩子
But it turned out to be one of the best

403
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,780
最美好的經歷
experiences of my life.

404
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,580
因為我全身心投入了
Because I gave myself over to it.

405
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,580
那個溫暖  感傷又煙霧彌漫的周末
All I remember is this warm gooey haze of a weekend

406
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,740
充滿了愛和情感共鳴
filled with love and connection.

407
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,900
結束的時候
And at the end of it,

408
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,420
出現了個嬰兒
I wound up with a baby.

409
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,290
哈貝爾是在伍德斯托克被懷上的
Hubbell was conceived at Woodstock?

410
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,780
我沒在比喻  我離開時打開包一看
No, literally. I opened my bag as I was leaving

411
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,410
發現有人錯把嬰兒放進來了
and somebody had slipped a baby inside.

412
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,690
天哪  然后呢
Oh my god. What'd you do?

413
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,600
我把它留在停車場嬰兒丟失登記處
I just left it at the lost baby table in the parking lot.

414
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,060
那天有許多嬰兒被放錯包了
A lot of babies were put in the wrong purse that day.

415
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,380
伍德斯托克啊
Woodstock, huh?

416
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,380
洗手間環境怎么樣
What's the bathroom situation there?

417
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,430
-你好  -檢查一下你的信箱
- Hello? - Check your mailbox.

418
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,220
-它里面有東西在響嗎  -我寄了東西給你
- Is it ticking? - I put something in it for you.

419
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,510
-薩莎嗎  -對  向我保證你會檢查信箱
- Sasha? - Yes, just make sure you go and check

420
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,040
因為有時候你懶得查看
your mailbox because sometimes you don't.

421
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,320
你怎么知道
Why do you know about my mailbox?

422
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,420
因為有時候我們路過
Because sometimes we walk by

423
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,610
看到信件都滿出來了
and all the mail is spilling out

424
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,640
像是你永遠不檢查信箱
like you haven't checked it in forever,

425
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,520
我們懷疑你是不是掛了
And we wonder if you're dead,

426
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,580
不過沒人愿意進去看看
but no one wants to look.

427
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,040
萬一我需要幫助怎么辦
Hey, what if I need help?

428
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,150
如果你真掛了  那要幫也晚了
If you're dead, it's too late for help.

429
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,600
說得對  等等  五分鐘后就要彩排了
Good point. Wait a minute, rehearsal's in five minutes.

430
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,190
-所以呢  -你還沒到嗎
- So? - Aren't you here?

431
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,900
-不是吧  -怎么了
- Really? - What?

432
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,480
你還用得著打電話嗎
So you had to call?

433
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,050
你一轉眼就看到我了
You were gonna see me in three seconds.

434
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,950
我想請你參加我的喬遷派對
I wanted to invite you to my housewarming party.

435
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,290
你已經給我寄過邀請函了
But you already sent me an invitation.

436
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,690
沒錯  可你從不查郵箱
Yes, but you never check your mail,

437
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,160
誰知道你會不會看到
so who knows if you'd find it.

438
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,290
你打給我就是讓我查郵箱收信
You're calling to tell me to check my mail

439
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,020
所以我應該會收到的
to find it, so chances are I'll find it.

440
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,180
還記得我們藏在
Remember when we hid that

441
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,500
你包里的那串爛香蕉嗎
bunch of rotting bananas in your dance bag?

442
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,130
有這事  怪不得有股怪味道
You did? That's the smell?

443
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,810
去查你的郵箱
Check your box.

444
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,330
我看到一些照片哦
I found pictures.

445
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,270
簡直無法直視
Gah, must unsee.

446
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,780
在我看來像"永琲熄坏"那么刺眼
"Eternal sunshine" my mind.

447
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,570
你在維加斯待過  這有什么稀奇的
You lived in Vegas. How can this be shocking?

448
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,400
即使是在維加斯也會有人說
Okay, if that happened in Vegas, even Vegas would be saying,

449
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,380
"快來看啊  把他們趕出維加斯"
"Tell someone about this. Don't let it stay in Vegas."

450
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,620
伙伴們
Hey, partners.

451
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,390
米利  真是個驚喜啊
Milly, what a nice surprise.

452
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,260
我又帶來幾張支票
I just came by to drop off a couple more checks.

453
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,930
誰知道引座員的制服會這么貴
Who knew usher uniforms could be so expensive?

454
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,800
-是嗎  -難不成是羊駝毛做的
- Really? - What, are they made of vicuna or something?

455
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,860
我不知道是什么材料的
I don't know what they're made of,

456
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,970
不過看這價格  我自己都想
but at those prices, I'm gonna start

457
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,040
去做這生意了
selling them myself.

458
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,370
對于你的大力贊助
Just know how grateful we are to you

459
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,220
我們真是非常感激
for your patronage.

460
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,330
好了  各位  熱身結束
All right, everyone, finish warming up.

461
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,630
五分鐘后開始彩排
Rehearsal in five minutes.

462
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,030
范妮  我在想
Um, Fanny, I was wondering

463
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,220
-這會兒合不合適  -合適干什么
- if this might be a good time. - For what?

464
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,070
為我這個贊助人來一次彩排
Well, for my backer's rehearsal.

465
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,160
-你的什么  -我的贊助人彩排
- Your what? - My backer's rehearsal.

466
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,550
是為投資人準備的預先表演
It's a special advance performance for investors.

467
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,930
我們當然知道贊助人彩排是什么
Yeah, we know what a backer's rehearsal is.

468
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,480
-看來你看《節目單》 -什么
- So you read "Playbill"? - What?

469
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,610
《節目單》  我剛進商業圈的時候
"Playbill." I started reading it

470
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,540
就開始看這本雜志了  這么說吧
the minute I became a player in the biz, so to speak,

471
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,140
現在我簡直就是迷上了
and now I'm totally addicted.

472
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,340
你們知道《孟菲斯》的主演
Did you know the lead in "Memphis"

473
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,170
剛預定要拍一部情景喜劇嗎
just booked a sitcom?

474
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,830
-我們不知道  -是真的
- We did not know that. - It's true.

475
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,900
那么現在行嗎
So is now a good time?

476
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,220
反正你們現在也準備彩排了  那...
It seems like you're about ready to rehearse now anyhow, so...

477
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,390
米利  這絕對不...
Milly, this would absolutely not--

478
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,540
范妮  我能
Fanny, can I--

479
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,910
借一步說話嗎
over here for a sec.

480
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,000
她瘋了嗎
Is she out of her mind?

481
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,170
以她的名字命名露天劇場還不夠嗎
Isn't it enough I let her put her name on the amphitheater?

482
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,220
錯了  是命名藝術表演中心啊
Excuse me, on the performance center?

483
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,730
假裝我們是在看時間表
Pretend to be looking at our schedule.

484
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,480
藝術表演中心和劇院可不一樣
A performance center isn't a theater.

485
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,940
那是邁克爾·菲爾普斯訓練的地方
It's where Michael Phelps goes to train.

486
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,100
邁克爾·菲爾普斯 美國游泳巨星

487
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,320
-我知道  -那可是測試
- I know. - It's where they test

488
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,450
-昂貴德國跑車的地方  -說得對
- expensive German sports cars. - Don't disagree.

489
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,710
是男人名義上說去修車  實際上
It's where men with defective equipment have pumps installed

490
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,600
背著老婆去勾搭瑜伽教練的地方
so that they can leave their wives for a yoga teacher.

491
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,010
回到我們的話題上
Okay, come back to me here.

492
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,110
這是一種冒犯
This is an invasion.

493
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,560
她可以等到一切就緒以后再看表演
She can see the show when it's ready.

494
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,870
-和別人一樣  -這太吹毛求疵了
- Just like everyone else. - Okay, devil's advocate.

495
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,760
如果沒有米利  我們根本不會有劇場
If it weren't for Milly, we wouldn't have a theater,

496
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,820
或者燈光  服裝
or lights, or costumes.

497
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,380
更別說身材這么好的引座員了
And let's not forget the well-built ushers.

498
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,340
那確實是額外福利
That's definitely a perk.

499
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,450
她只是想看看彩排
She just wants to see a rehearsal

500
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,890
我們正好就要彩排
and we're already doing a rehearsal.

501
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,630
讓她觀賞一小段優美的舞蹈
Letting her watch a little pretty dancing

502
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,470
只是點小意思罷了
seems like a small price to pay.

503
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,790
好吧
Well...

504
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,600
告訴你個好消息
We have some good news.

505
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,150
我們查過了時間表
We checked our schedule,

506
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,860
應該現在就可以為你這位贊助人
and it looks like we can do your backer's rehearsal

507
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,130
-進行彩排表演  -真的嗎
- right now. - Really?

508
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,350
-真的  -太好了
- Really. - Great.

509
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,410
-只有一個小問題  -什么
- There's just one small problem. - What?

510
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,070
贊助人彩排
Well, backer's rehearsals

511
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,680
一般都要準備精美的食物
usually have beautiful spreads of food.

512
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,250
壽司拼盤  香檳酒
Sushi platters, champagne,

513
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,030
有一次我還見過有可麗餅的
one time I saw a crepe guy.

514
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,970
很遺憾因為通知得太倉促
It's just a shame that this is on such short notice.

515
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,030
-我們來不及準備  -等我打個電話
- We couldn't arrange that. - Let me make a call.

516
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,640
至少我們能吃好吃的
At least we're gonna eat.

517
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,320
你怎么在這兒
What are you doing here?

518
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,460
我想你不會相信
I don't suppose you'd believe

519
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,720
我是來報名的吧
I'm signing up for class?

520
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,620
喚醒我的巴里什尼科夫之魂
Channeling my inner Baryshnikov?

521
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,200
巴里什尼科夫 著名舞蹈家

522
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,510
不信
No.

523
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,790
其實我來這是想看看你
Then I guess I was hoping I'd run into you.

524
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,370
最近都沒怎么見你
I haven't seen you around lately.

525
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,380
是啊
Oh, yeah.

526
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,090
-我都忙暈了  -看出來了
- Things have been crazy. - I figured.

527
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,770
我是說  你的短信都不超過三個字
I mean, none of your texts are more than three letters long.

528
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,830
-抱歉  -有一半我都搞不懂
- Sorry. - I can't even figure out half of them.

529
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,010
"CTN"是什么意思
What does "CTN" Mean?

530
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,100
-現在沒法發短信  -好吧
- Can't text now. - Oh, of course.

531
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,950
視情況也可能是"現在沒法說話"
Or can't talk now depending on context.

532
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,500
你應該兩個意思都有
I think you've sent both.

533
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,170
真心抱歉  我最近生活一團糟
I'm really sorry. I've just been crazy with stuff, you know?

534
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,130
那你今晚忙嗎
Well, are you busy tonight?

535
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,100
-我在想  -今晚不行
- I was thinking... - I can't tonight.

536
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,220
-我  -行
- I'm... - yeah.

537
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,580
-好吧  -但我很快就能來找你
- Okay. - But we'll do something soon.

538
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,570
我保證
I promise.

539
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,100
我會發短信給你  這次四個字
I'll text you. Four letters this time.

540
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,620
米利  我們要開始了
So Milly, we'll be getting started in just a second.

541
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,540
-太激動人心了  -沒錯
- It's very exciting. - Oh, I know.

542
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,300
-大家都是  -你會很開心的
- For everyone. - And you'll be happy to know

543
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,680
我把硬糖包裝都拆了
I unwrapped my hard candy,

544
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,040
所以表演中不會有噪音干擾
so the noise won't be distracting during the performance.

545
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,410
我受寵若驚
I'm thrilled.

546
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,300
各位  今天的排練有位特殊來賓
Okay, class. We have a special guest for rehearsal today.

547
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,470
她是我們慷慨的贊助人  我們的天使
Our benevolent benefactor, our angel,

548
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,010
米利森特·斯通
Millicent Stone.

549
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,610
請叫我米利  當我不存在就行
Please, call me Milly and pretend I'm not here.

550
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,510
各就各位
Places, everyone.

551
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,540
從頭開始  然后蕾蕾的獨舞
We'll just run the opening, RayRay's solo,

552
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,020
最后是結尾
and then the ending.

553
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,720
-最需要加把勁的部分  -有道理
- Those need the most work anyhow. - Sounds.

554
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,060
她在干嘛
What is she doing?

555
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,800
音樂劇《歌廳》選段

556
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,710
慘不忍睹版的《我的先生們》嗎
A very poorly staged version of "Mein Herr"?

557
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,720
請放音樂
And music, please.

558
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,130
她不會...
She's not...

559
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,930
不是吧
No...

560
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,970
她在做筆記
She's taking notes.

561
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,400
-我要...  -別去
- I'm gonna... - No, you're not.

562
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,300
沒事的
It's okay.

563
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,260
大家跳得很好
Wonderful work, everyone.

564
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,080
非常非常好
Very very nice.

565
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,590
記住  下周三進行技術彩排
Now remember, we tech next Wednesday,

566
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,440
下周四進行服裝彩排
and dress on Thursday.

567
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,910
到時候見
I'll see you all then.

568
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,300
舞者們請到這里集中
Dancers to the chair, please.

569
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,810
她到底在說什么
What the hell is she talking about?

570
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,640
趕快  時間就是金錢
Let's go. Time is money.

571
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,320
什么事
Yes?

572
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,000
現在不行  我在做點評
Can't now. Have a note session.

573
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,350
好的  大部分跳得不錯
Okay, so a lot of good stuff here.

574
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,540
只有幾點不太行
Just a few things.

575
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,020
首先  奇怪你們怎么沒穿芭蕾舞裙
First off, it's very confusing that you're not wearing tutus.

576
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,910
人們去看芭蕾就是要看芭蕾舞裙的
People expect tutus when you go to the ballet.

577
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,540
-米利  -克制  克制
- Milly! - Back it up, back it up.

578
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,810
米利  這不是服裝彩排
Milly, it wasn't a dress rehearsal.

579
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,190
他們沒有穿戲服
They weren't in costume

580
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,920
因為這不是服裝彩排
Because it was not a dress rehearsal.

581
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,960
所以沒有盛裝打扮
So they weren't dressed.

582
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,160
我保證表演時會穿芭蕾舞裙的
I promise there will be tutus for the show.

583
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,900
很好  我們意見一致了
Oh. Oh, good. So we're on the same page.

584
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,390
很好  感謝你有益的建議
Great. So thank you for your helpful thoughts...

585
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,530
等一下
Hold on.

586
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,820
這個舞步太多了
There's too much of this step...

587
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,580
你是領舞  所以其他人就少跳點
You get the gist. So less of that for the whole group.

588
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,900
還有別轉來轉去的
And don't do the spinny thing.

589
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,400
我都看暈了
It makes me dizzy.

590
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,340
還有你  你有個動作
And you, you did this one move

591
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,110
看起來像是被絆倒了
where it looked like you were tripping.

592
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,310
其實就是我被絆倒了
That was when I tripped.

593
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,500
說得好  米利
Good catch, Milly.

594
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,340
你太對了  絆腳的動作得改掉
You're absolutely right. The tripping should change.

595
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,330
-對吧  范妮  -當然
- Right, fanny? - Sure.

596
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,150
有個問題  小矮人去哪了
And here's a question. Where are the dwarves?

597
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,080
小矮人
Dwarves?

598
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,520
我們演的是《睡美人》  得有小矮人啊
We're doing "Sleeping Beauty." There are supposed to be dwarves.

599
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,450
是《白雪公主》
In "Snow White."

600
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,060
小矮人是《白雪公主》里的角色
The dwarves are in "Snow White."

601
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,020
我們演的不是《睡美人和七個小矮人》
We are not doing "Sleeping Beauty And The Seven Dwarves."

602
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,990
我經常弄混
Oh, I always get those mixed up.

603
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,540
好的  下一條
Okay, next.

604
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,630
這么多鏡子是干嘛
What's with all the mirrors?

605
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,300
誰要一直看自己
Who needs to look at themselves that much?

606
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,150
好的  夠了  就這樣
All right. That's it. We're done.

607
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,710
等下  我還沒說完
Wait, I have more pages.

608
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,980
你想看排練
You wanted to see a rehearsal,

609
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,100
看也看了  到此為止
you saw it, we're done.

610
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,600
范妮
Look, Fanny,

611
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,510
《節目單》里不是說制作人可以點評的嗎
"Playbill" says a producer gets to give notes.

612
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,390
你不是制作人
You are not a producer.

613
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,710
我出的錢
I gave money.

614
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,670
制作人不就是給錢的人嗎
A producer is someone who gives money.

615
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,430
制作人有權發表看法
And a producer gets to have an opinion.

616
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,510
還有提出意見
And give notes.

617
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,000
而且他們還把刻有自己名字的椅子
And they usually have a chair with their name on it

618
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,220
我已經訂好了  周三前應該放到這
which I have ordered, and it should be here by Wednesday.

619
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,570
這就是當前藝術界的問題所在
And that is what is wrong with the arts today.

620
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,510
對藝術一竅不通的人
People with no knowledge at all

621
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,420
跟毒販子一樣在桌上扔一把錢
throw a wad of cash on the table like a drug dealer

622
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,960
大家就得言聽計從
and then everybody listens.

623
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,780
我這可不吃這一套
Well, not me and not here.

624
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,270
金牌電影制作人

625
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,350
你不是斯考特·魯丁
You are not Scott Rudin

626
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,160
這也不是約翰尼·德普的電影
and this is not a Johnny Depp movie.

627
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,500
這是我的工作室  我的作品
This is my studio and my production.

628
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,910
你絕對沒有權利評頭論足
And you have absolutely no right to give notes.

629
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,170
如果你有意見
And if that's a problem,

630
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,370
就寫封信給《節目單》
you can just write a letter to "Playbill"

631
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,820
和他們討論去吧
and work it out with them.

632
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,650
你們干嘛要聽她訓話
Why are you all listening to her?

633
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,710
你說她是我們的天使
You said she was our angel.

634
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,180
大家都出去吧
Everybody out.

635
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,660
所有人
Everybody!

636
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,790
如果你不采納我的提議
If you won't let me have my input,

637
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,950
那我要撤回投資
then I want my money back.

638
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,040
你明知道那些錢已經花掉了
You know that money's already spent.

639
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,830
我會起訴的
I'll sue.

640
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,790
那人們就會說你是那個
Then you'll just be known as that mean little woman

641
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,440
起訴鎮上芭蕾舞學校
that sued the town ballet school

642
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,470
毀了所有孩子夢想的吝嗇女人
and crushed all the children's dreams.

643
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,890
我才不管  如果你不信
I don't care. You can talk to

644
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,910
你可以去豪威爾的婦女中心打聽打聽
that Women's Center on Howell if you don't believe me.

645
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,440
現在那里變成干洗店了
They're a dry-cleaners now.

646
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,250
隨你  起訴吧
Fine! Sue!

647
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,610
現在就給律師打電話
Calling lawyers now.

648
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,830
呼叫律師
Call lawyers.

649
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,440
呼叫律師
Call lawyers.

650
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,420
這有點...
Uh, so, that was kind of...

651
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,000
我知道
I know.

652
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,100
我們干嘛要帶這么多東西
I don't know why we are bringing all these.

653
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,700
這是個派對  人們都這么做
It's a party. It's what people do.

654
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,390
可派對的精髓在于
But the point of chips at a party

655
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,600
開懷暢飲
is to soak up booze.

656
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,330
這只是個16歲孩子舉辦的派對
This party's being thrown by a 16-year-old.

657
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,870
重點就在這  薩莎還是個孩子
That's just it. Sasha's a kid.

658
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,990
她可能準備的食物不夠
She won't have gotten enough food

659
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,140
然后派對無聊至極
and the party will suck

660
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,290
然后人人都會叫她瑪麗·理查茲
and everyone will call her Mary Richards.

661
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,000
上世紀70年代  美國情景喜劇女主角
被未婚夫拋棄自己一人打拼的女性形象

662
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,970
好吧  嘮叨老太婆
Yes, grandma. I'm sure all the kids

663
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,670
我肯定她會搞砸了
will be calling her Mary Richards.

664
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,250
我去拿面包做意式烤面包片
Hey, just getting bread for the bruschetta.

665
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,340
這是個16歲孩子的公寓
This is a 16-year-old's apartment?

666
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,020
或是奧茲仙境  簡直就是奧茲仙境
Or Oz. It could be Oz.

667
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,820
《綠葉仙蹤》中的奧茲仙境

668
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,700
-她還有壁爐  -還有柴火
- She's got a fireplace. - And wood.

669
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,930
有柴火在壁爐里燒
There's wood burning in the fireplace.

670
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,300
我在俄勒岡州住的時候  也有一個壁爐
I had a fireplace when I lived in Oregon.

671
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,760
有窩老鼠在那安家
The rats nested in it.

672
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,190
快看餐桌
Check out the food table.

673
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,710
她還有那種下面
Oh, she's got those metal containers

674
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,230
可以點蠟燭的金屬鍋
with the candle thingies under them.

675
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,800
那是小火鍋  她居然有小火鍋
Chafing dishes, she's got chafing dishes.

676
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,210
-勞駕  -什么事
- Excuse me? - Yes?

677
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,020
麻煩你給我找個靠枕
Could you please get me a pillow?

678
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,650
好的
Sure.

679
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,190
但別拿太好的
But don't take a nice one.

680
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,000
那我只能回我家給你拿了
Then I'll have to run back to my place.

681
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,860
去看看衛生間
Let's check out the bathroom.

682
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,820
她準許客人進去嗎
Does she let people go in there?

683
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,870
反正我要去
I'm going in.

684
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,340
我該現在加果仁嗎
Okay, now do I add the nuts?

685
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,870
瑪莎說蛋白充分打勻之后
Martha says when the egg white has been properly beaten,

686
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,390
碗底沒有明顯的液體殘留
no clear liquid should remain at the bottom of the bowl.

687
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,630
我沒看到明顯的液體殘留
I see no clear liquid.

688
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,420
-那就聽瑪莎的  -加入果仁
- Then follow Martha. - Adding the nuts.

689
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,560
水管沒問題
Pipes look good.

690
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,860
轉賣的時候能加不少價
That adds a lot of resale value.

691
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,110
在這別來房產中介那套  金妮
Take your broker's vest off, Ginny.

692
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,390
糟了  我忘了拿潘趣酒要加的冰環
Oh, shoot. I forgot the ice ring for the punch.

693
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,380
我來拿
Ooh, I'll get it.

694
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,800
好漂亮
It's so pretty.

695
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,110
那些三色堇是可食用的
The pansies are edible.

696
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,770
繡了名字的毛巾
Monogrammed towels.

697
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,120
她居然有繡了名字的毛巾
She has monogrammed towels.

698
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,220
-看到了  -不是應該要
- I saw. - Don't you need, like,

699
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,830
六周才能弄到繡有名字的東西嗎
six weeks to get something monogrammed?

700
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,550
不知道  我是用記號筆在內褲上寫名字
No idea. I write my name on my underpants with a sharpie.

701
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,380
那個不是你當啦啦隊長的朋友嗎
Hey, isn't that your cheerleading friend?

702
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,470
奧布麗  我根本沒請她
Aubrey. I didn't even invite her.

703
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,960
啦啦隊長能感應到有派對
Cheerleaders can sense parties.

704
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,420
天生的能力  她們還能
It's innate. It's like their ability

705
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,340
讓你覺得自己很卑微
to make people feel small.

706
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,640
薩莎
Sasha!

707
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,640
我不請自來不要緊吧
I hope it's okay that I came,

708
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,990
當我聽說我的朋友薩莎
'cause when I heard my friend Sasha

709
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,640
要舉辦派對  我覺得非來不可
was having a party, I just had to be here.

710
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,750
當然  朋友
Of course. Friend.

711
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,180
波  幫我照看一下
Oh, hey, Boo, will you stir for me?

712
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,350
我去去就回
I'll be right back.

713
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,740
你好  我是奧布麗
Hi, I'm Aubrey.

714
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,430
我是金妮  我們之前見過的
I'm Ginny. We've met before.

715
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,050
不可能
No.

716
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,560
-見過幾次  -沒有吧
- Several times. - I don't think so.

717
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,680
我們上同一節化學課
We're in the same chem class.

718
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,700
-你確定嗎  -我們是實驗搭檔
- Are you sure? - We're lab partners.

719
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,790
完全沒印象
Not ringing any bells.

720
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,420
-你好  奧布麗  -瑪蒂
- Hey, Aubrey! - Maddie, hi!

721
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,520
你怎么樣
How are you?

722
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,770
對她們而言  這就像呼吸一樣平常
It's like breathing to them.

723
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
你來啦
You made it.

724
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,840
-我們來了  -你就是那個16歲小屁孩
- We made it. - You're the 16-year-old?

725
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,830
那么兇干嘛
What's with the hostile tone?

726
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,960
我有點被刺激到了
I'm a little pissed by all this.

727
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,710
別理他  不過這地方好得沒話說
Ignore him. But still, this place.

728
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,480
還有家具  你還有水桶
And the furniture, and you have a bucket.

729
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,760
-必須的  -那可不一定
- Of course. - Not of course.

730
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,770
我就從來沒有水桶
I've never owned a bucket.

731
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:51,850
我也沒有  都是找人借的
I haven't either. You borrow buckets.

732
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,010
-懂我說的意思嗎  -別理他
- You know what I mean? - Ignore him.

733
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,990
是你先提水桶的
You brought up the bucket.

734
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,780
跟我來  帶你看點東西
Come on. I want to show you something.

735
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,280
這房間真漂亮
Wow. What a great room.

736
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,670
愛死這個梳妝臺和這些枕頭了
I love the dresser and the pillows.

737
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,480
還有嬌艷欲滴的鮮花和粉紅小青蛙
And how the fresh-cut flowers pick up the pink in the frog.

738
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,400
你早就進來過了  是吧
You've already been in here, haven't you?

739
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,890
當然
Totally.

740
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,790
所有東西都翻過了  內衣柜都沒放過
Went through your underwear drawer and everything.

741
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,900
你能教我怎么
Hey, can you show me how to do that thing

742
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,220
把襪子弄成一個個小球么
where you fold up your socks into tiny little balls?

743
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,130
這就是我想讓你看的
This is what I wanted you to see.

744
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,250
你從舞蹈教室偷來的嗎
Did you steal it from the studio?

745
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,740
當然不是  我專門請人裝上的
No. I had it put in.

746
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,730
在喬佛里芭蕾舞校  有個女孩告訴我
At Joffrey, there was this girl

747
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,330
她爸爸給她在房間里裝了扶手杠
who told me her dad put a barre in her room

748
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,500
讓她每天晚上都能練習
so she could practice every night,

749
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,740
而且她真跳得很好
and she was really good.

750
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,880
所以我想  要趕上她
So I figured if I'm gonna get that good,

751
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,200
我也要裝個扶手杠
I need a barre too.

752
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,630
好極了
Very nice.

753
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,710
看吧  我是認真的
See? Serious.

754
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,870
的確
You are.

755
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,530
看起來像是你會做的事
Seemed like something you would do.

756
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,470
你計劃好遭入室搶劫時的逃生路線了嗎
So, hey, do you have your home invasion escape plan set yet?

757
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,160
-那是什么  -這是我每搬進新地方
- What's that? - Ah, it's the first thing I do

758
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,440
都會做的第一件事
anytime I move in someplace new.

759
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,860
是單身女孩的居家必備
It's a total single girl must.

760
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,840
我會環顧房間四周  然后設想
See? I look around a room and I think

761
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,770
如果歹徒從正門進來
the home invader is coming in through the front door,

762
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,880
那我該躲哪呢
so where do I go?

763
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,420
絕對不能躲在衣柜里
You don't want to hide in the closet

764
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,820
因為歹徒一定會檢查衣柜
'cause he will check the closet

765
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,310
如果你被困在里面  很顯然
and then you're trapped, so obviously, you're,

766
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,450
你的小命就不保了
you know, see ya.

767
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,110
好?  你住在一樓
Now, you're on the first floor

768
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,570
這意味著你可以從窗戶跳出去
which means you can jump out the window

769
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,130
這好極了  但也意味著
which is awesome except it also means

770
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,000
歹徒可以從窗戶進來
the home invader can come in through the window.

771
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,520
所以你需要第二條逃生路線
which means you need a second escape route.

772
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,190
而且  你得祈禱來犯的不是一群歹徒
Plus, you hope it's not a group of home invaders

773
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,690
就像《即刻救援》里面演的  那...
like in "Taken", so...

774
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,500
法國驚悚動作片

775
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,800
不過我從沒遭到過襲擊
And nobody ever attacked me

776
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,730
平安無事  還撿到一只小貓咪
and I was safe and I got a kitten.

777
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,900
我們再去看看那個桶好了
Let's see that bucket again.

778
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,850
我把面包買來了
I got the bread.

779
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,030
失陪一下  別亂翻我的衣柜
Excuse me a second. Don't go through my closet.

780
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,040
也就是說衣柜里肯定有寶貝
That must mean there's something good in there.

781
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,410
好像看到某人的翻版喲
Well well well, somebody's got a mini-me.

782
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,750
少胡說八道
Stop.

783
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,880
看得出來她很崇拜[抬頭看]你
She totally looks up to you.

784
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,640
是啊  誰讓我那么高
Yeah, 'cause I'm eight feet tall.

785
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,710
我覺得這很有愛
I think it's cute.

786
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,800
但也有點危險
And a little dangerous.

787
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,110
-所以說你的吸塵機沒有塵袋  -沒有
- So your vacuum cleaner doesn't need bags.  - No.

788
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,000
無塵袋款性能更好  吸率更強

789
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,910
吸力也不會下降
And there's no loss of suction?

790
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,230
我用著覺得沒問題
None that I've noticed.

791
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,370
我去給你多加些冰
Here, let me get more ice for you.

792
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,920
我是奧布麗
Hi, I'm Aubrey.

793
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,690
-我是金妮  -真好
- Ginny. - Good for you.

794
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,360
-什么意思  -真希望我能像你一樣
- What? - I wish I could be one of those girls

795
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,680
大吃特吃毫不在乎身材
who just doesn't care.

796
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,910
等我有了自己的公寓
When I get an apartment,

797
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,530
我要把棖ㄗ磞邑礎
I'm gonna paint all the walls black

798
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,930
然后在天花板上掛滿銀色閃片
and hang silver tinsel from the ceiling.

799
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,560
-聽起來好嚇人  -怎么著也沒
- That's terrifying. - Not as terrifying

800
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,540
你的貴妃椅嚇人
as your fainting couch.

801
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,550
瑪莎說貴妃椅
Martha said a fainting couch is the perfect way

802
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,740
最利于采光
to create seating without blocking natural light.

803
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,030
她只是嫉妒罷了
She's just jealous.

804
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,830
我們都嫉妒得不行  你的公寓太贊了
We all are. This place is amazing.

805
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,550
我們絕對要把這當做我們的秘密基地
We should totally make it our hangout.

806
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,070
就像明妮·德瑞弗演胖子的
Like in that Irish movie

807
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,240
那部愛爾蘭電影一樣
where Minnie Driver is fat.

808
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,100
著名英國女演員

809
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,450
而且他們在樹林里還有家俱樂部
And they had that clubhouse in the woods

810
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,620
供他們開派對用
where they would all go for parties

811
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,590
還可以用作秘密幽會的地點
and secret trysts?

812
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,970
把這當作我們的愛爾蘭式秘密幽會基地吧
Yes, this could be our secret Irish trysty place.

813
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,350
沒問題  今晚留下來睡吧
Done. Hey, stay over tonight.

814
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,350
我們可以正式啟動俱樂部
we'll initiate the clubhouse.

815
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,760
-我恐怕不行  -我也是
- Oh, I can't. - Me either.

816
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,820
爸媽早就下了禁令
Parents shot the idea down.

817
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,700
但這是你的主意啊
It was your idea.

818
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,370
全程"無成人監護"活動
The whole "no adult supervision" thing

819
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,520
-是絕對禁止的  -沒錯  過界了
- is a no go. - Yeah, it was a big deal.

820
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,120
我們都發過毒誓
There was oath swearing and everything.

821
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,000
好吧
Oh. Okay.

822
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,260
但我們可以白天過來玩
But we can hang out during the day.

823
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,070
我們會想到對策的
And we'll work out a system eventually.

824
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,940
-明天見  -好  謝謝你們能來
- See you tomorrow? - Yes. Thanks for coming.

825
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,110
把剩菜帶回去吧
Take leftovers.

826
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,580
你們也要走了嗎
You guys going?

827
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,290
有段神秘的旅程等著我們呢
We have a mysterious something to get to.

828
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,070
-這派對很贊  -謝了
- It was a great party. - Thanks.

829
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,340
最后送你們個離別小禮物
Let me get you a favor.

830
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,040
-巧克力夾心甜餅  -還是熱的
- Chocolate chip. - And they're warm.

831
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,070
我的老天爺啊
Oh my god.

832
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,480
聽著  孩子
Listen, kid,

833
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,790
再給你一條建議
one more piece of advice.

834
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,510
別和隔壁的老太太混得太熟
Don't bond with the old lady next door.

835
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,290
-韋德梅爾奶奶  -如果看見她房門開著
- Mrs. Weidemeyer? - You see her door open,

836
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,700
立馬繞道走  而且無論如何
dive for cover. And whatever you do,

837
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,910
別告訴她你有車
do not tell her you have a car.

838
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,080
老太太都是奸詐的大騙子
Old ladies are giant con artists.

839
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,610
-騙子  -他們都是從些小事開始
- Con artists? - They start small.

840
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,960
讓你送她去集市或是毛線商店
Trips to the market and the yarn shop,

841
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,100
但沒一會你就會發現
but before you know it you're picking up

842
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,420
自己在晚上11點幫他們取處方藥
their prescriptions at 11:00 at night

843
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,420
并且在他們髖關節脫臼的時候
and driving them to the hospital

844
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,630
開車送他們去醫院  然后你覺得
when their hips break. And you think--

845
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,730
他們只有兩個髖關節  能脫臼幾次呢
they only have two hips, how many can they break?

846
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,710
答案是18次
18.

847
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,070
因為他們會一次又一次地脫臼
Because they break the same hips over and over.

848
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,290
明白了
Got it.

849
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,020
親愛的  我喉嚨有點干
Sweetie, my throat's a little dry.

850
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,180
你能幫我拿顆潤喉糖嗎
Could you get me a lozenge?

851
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
當然
Sure.

852
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,530
-那個女孩不正常  -我同意
- That girl is not normal. - I'm not disagreeing.

853
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,960
整個房間都沒有水煙槍
There wasn't a bong in the entire place.

854
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,230
我在她這個年紀時  房里只有水煙槍
When I was her age, everything in my room

855
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,420
剩下的全是能做成煙槍的東西
was either a bong or something I could make into a bong.

856
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,180
我25歲才擁有一臺電器
I was 25 before I owned an appliance.

857
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,840
是一臺用過的微波爐
It was a used microwave that had permanent

858
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,860
還沾有去不掉的湯漬  并且我很肯定
soup stains and I'm pretty sure

859
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,160
那臺微波爐輻射了我的卵巢
radiated my ovaries.

860
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,500
-我們該回去了  -對
- We should hit it. - Mmm.

861
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,200
記住  道路準則
So remember, rules of the road,

862
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,750
-別把你的座椅往后靠  -拜托
- no putting your seat back. - Come on.

863
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,910
-你會睡著的  -所以呢
- You'll fall asleep. - So?

864
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,430
所以你睡著了而我睡不著  這不公平
So it's not fair that you get to sleep and I don't.

865
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,670
如果你把座椅往后靠  你就會睡著
And if you put your seat back, you will go to sleep.

866
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,610
好吧  我跟你做個交易
All right, I'll make you a deal.

867
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,690
我保證我不睡著
I promise I won't fall asleep

868
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,040
如果你能保證車里有個廁所的話
if you promise me there's a bathroom at this thing.

869
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,750
行了  把你的座椅往后靠吧
Fine. Put your seat back.

870
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,380
你好  米利  很高興你能趕來
Hello, Milly. Glad you could make it.

871
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,900
謝謝你的邀請
Thank you for the invitation.

872
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,340
我可以幫你拿包嗎
May I take your purse?

873
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,310
干嘛
Why?

874
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,250
我只是覺得你把包放下會更加舒服
I just thought you'd be more comfortable without it.

875
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,460
-當真  -真的
- Really? - Really.

876
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,850
我拿著好了  謝謝
I'll keep it. Thank you.

877
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,510
我廚房的整修沒完沒了的
My kitchen remodel is taking forever.

878
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,400
所以我只能叫外賣
So I had to order in.

879
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,860
希望你喜歡布隆迪的菜
I hope you like Blondie's.

880
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,500
我挺喜歡他們的  他們按時交租
I do like them. They pay on time

881
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,820
而且沒有太多抱怨
and don't complain too much.

882
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,990
你還租給他們嗎
You rent to them too?

883
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,770
我的顧客名單是機密
My client list is confidential.

884
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,810
坐吧  米利
Have a seat, Milly.

885
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,430
要水嗎
Water?

886
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,870
水是生命之源
It's the staff of life.

887
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,040
我們自己動手  沒問題吧
Okay if we just serve ourselves?

888
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,910
我知道這不正式
It's informal, I know.

889
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,930
但這里不是唐頓莊園  對吧
But we're not sitting in Downton Abbey, are we?

890
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:54,690
沒錯
No.

891
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,990
絕對不是
Not by a long shot.

892
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,520
米利  咱們直入主題吧
I'll cut to the chase here, Milly.

893
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,590
早些時候我反應過激了
I overreacted earlier.

894
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,300
你試圖幫我拿包的時候嗎
When you tried to take my purse?

895
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,300
在贊助人彩排時
At the backer's rehearsal.

896
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,270
我同意
I agree.

897
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,200
但你要明白  是你把我逼到那份兒上的
But you have to understand, you forced me to act that way.

898
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,330
怎么說
How do you figure?

899
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,050
在創意活動上你的經驗不足
You haven't had a lot of experience with creative endeavors.

900
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,310
藝術創造不能民主
Creating art is not democratic.

901
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,670
這些胡蘿卜看起來不錯
These carrots look good.

902
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,110
我的舞蹈室是我的王國
My dance studio is my kingdom.

903
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,900
而我就是執政君主
And I am the reigning monarch,

904
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,890
我不習慣有人干預我
and I am not accustomed to input.

905
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,350
你可以創造一切你想要的
You can create all you want.

906
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,280
但如果你沒有一個舞臺去呈現
But if you don't have a stage to put it on,

907
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,520
那就是無用的
it's useless.

908
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,620
這上面是什么
What's on this?

909
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,430
-龍蒿  -好惡心
- Tarragon. - Yuck.

910
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,060
聽著  米利
Look, Milly,

911
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,360
我倆在這兒各自扮演著重要的角色
we each have a role here and they're both important,

912
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,860
但你踩過界了
but you stepped on mine.

913
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,220
當你握有財政大權時  就可以那么做
When you're the money person, you get to do that.

914
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,910
你可以踩在別人頭上嗎
You get to step on people?

915
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,200
外交上來說  是的
Diplomatically speaking.

916
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,540
沒有踩在別人頭上的外交方式
There's no diplomatic way to step on people.

917
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,350
這是你點的全部東西嗎
Is this all you ordered?

918
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,240
你總是對的  是嗎  米利
You're always right, is that it, Milly?

919
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,070
-你總是對的  -幾乎總是
- You're always right. - Close to always.

920
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,230
-真的嗎  -沒錯
- Really? - Yes.

921
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,230
知道什么是生命之源嗎  米利
Well, guess what the staff of life is, Milly.

922
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,140
不是水  而是面包
It's not water. It's bread.

923
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,130
我很肯定就是水
I'm pretty sure it's water.

924
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,650
-就是面包  -兩者都是
- It's bread. - It's both.

925
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,710
它們都很重要  人類缺水會死
They're both important. People die without water.

926
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,170
我們離題了
We're getting off the subject here.

927
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,490
是你先跑題的
You brought up bread.

928
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,270
為了我們合作關系的進行
For this partnership to work,

929
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,620
你需要做些讓步
you need to meet me halfway.

930
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,730
至少你能這么做
You can at least do that.

931
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,050
如果我不想  我就不做
Not if I don't want to.

932
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,670
順便問一下  你有面包嗎
By the way, do you have any bread?

933
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,390
瞧見沒  這就是沒人喜歡你的原因
See, this is why nobody likes you.

934
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,290
就是因為你的倔脾氣
This pig-headed stubbornness of yours.

935
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,810
不  大家不喜歡我的原因是我太富有了
No. The reason people don't like me is because I have money.

936
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,760
這不是大家不喜歡你的原因
That's not why people don't like you.

937
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,550
如果你明天就變成窮光蛋
If you lost all your money tomorrow,

938
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,090
人們還是會不喜歡你
people would still dislike you.

939
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,640
對  他們還是會不喜歡我
No. They would dislike me

940
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,530
因為他們嫉妒我有錢
because when I had money they were jealous.

941
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,680
沒人喜歡有錢的人
No one likes people with money.

942
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,080
他們喜歡沃倫·巴菲特[股神]
They like Warren Buffett.

943
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,070
饒了我吧
Give me a break.

944
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,280
他擁有喜詩糖果
The man owns See's Candy.

945
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,280
1972年巴菲特用2500萬美元收購了喜詩糖果

946
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,440
人人都喜歡喜詩糖果
Everyone likes See's Candy.

947
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,190
他們喜歡的是糖果  不是他
They like the candy, not the man.

948
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,390
只有他家人喜歡他
Only his family likes the man

949
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,580
因為等他死了他家人就能分錢了
because when the man dies they'll get money.

950
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,640
你想要什么  米利
What do you want, Milly?

951
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,480
你的底線是什么
What's the bottom line here?

952
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,550
底線嗎
Bottom line?

953
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,640
我受夠了只被人當作商人
I'm tired of being considered just a businessperson.

954
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,730
我希望在藝術方面被人重視
I want to be considered important in the arts.

955
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,840
這只是個小鎮上的小小芭蕾舞工作室
It's a ballet studio in a small town.

956
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,050
這只是個開頭
It's a starting point.

957
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,130
這需要了解很多事情的
There's a lot to know.

958
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,640
不是只要出錢就行的
It's not just about giving money.

959
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,230
我想了解所有的事情
Well, I want to know all there is.

960
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,540
如果有必要的話
If that's what it takes.

961
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,720
好吧
Fine.

962
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,110
那我會給你書  光盤
Then I will give you books, DVDs.

963
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:04,160
我會親自教你跳舞和芭蕾
I will personally teach you about dance and ballet.

964
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,600
我會讓我的鋼琴家
And I'll have my pianist

965
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,920
教你所有你想知道的關于音樂的東西
teach you everything you want to know about music.

966
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,450
怎么了
What?

967
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,810
聽起來是一場持久戰
Sounds mondo time-consuming.

968
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,030
絕對是場持久戰
It is mondo time-consuming.

969
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,430
這么問你吧  米利
Let me ask you this, Milly.

970
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,030
你是想了解藝術
Do you want to know the arts

971
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,350
還是只想看起來像了解藝術的人
or just be perceived as someone who knows the arts?

972
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,640
后者需要花多長時間
What kind of time commitment would the second one be?

973
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,480
-幾乎不用時間  -繼續
- Hardly any. - I'm listening.

974
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,810
我們做個交易吧
Let's make a deal.

975
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,390
我很樂意告訴任何你想告訴的人
I will gladly tell anyone you want

976
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,630
你是個藝術大師
that you are a master of the arts.

977
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,240
作為交換  你把創意主導權完全交給我
In exchange, you will leave the creative end completely to me.

978
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,720
怎么樣
What do you say?

979
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,350
范妮  我們交易達成
Fanny, I think we have a deal.

980
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,420
很好
Good.

981
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,490
你會告訴別人穿芭蕾舞裙是我的主意嗎
Will you tell people it was my idea to wear the tutus?

982
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,870
當然
Absolutely.

983
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,320
派對辦得不錯
It was a lovely party.

984
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,040
特別周到
So grown up.

985
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,190
老天哦  我都沒想到你夠年齡開車了
Heavens, I didn't even think you were old enough to have a car.

986
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,550
你有車嗎
Do you have a car?

987
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,810
沒有  沒車  全靠走的
Nope. No car. Just feet.

988
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,770
你好
Oh. Hey.

989
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,500
-你好  -你怎么在這
- Hey. - What are you doing here?

990
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,920
我聽說你在辦派對
I heard you were having a party.

991
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,570
對
Oh, yeah.

992
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,190
看來我的邀請函迷路了
Guess my invitation got lost?

993
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,220
我能進去嗎
So can I come in?

994
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,170
當然
Sure.

995
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,150
是誰告訴你的
Who told you about it?

996
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,080
奧布麗來我的比賽做啦啦隊
Aubrey was cheering at my game.

997
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,960
她以為我被邀請了
She assumed I was invited.

998
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,850
你什么時候又開始打籃球了
When did you start playing basketball again?

999
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,050
三周以前
Three weeks ago.

1000
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,090
-這樣  -對
- Oh. - Yep.

1001
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,320
離我們上次聊天好像有一陣子了
It's kind of been a while since we've talked.

1002
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,040
我們現在在哪來著
So where are we anyway?

1003
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,780
我的公寓里
My apartment.

1004
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,090
你的什么
Your what?

1005
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,730
我的公寓
My apartment.

1006
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,270
那是個喬遷派對
It was a housewarming party.

1007
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,430
你有了一個公寓卻沒有告訴我
You got an apartment and never told me.

1008
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,710
一整個公寓  你真的搬家了嗎
A whole apartment. You actually moved?

1009
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:08,940
是臨時決定的
It was sudden.

1010
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,590
英國著名音樂家

1011
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,250
所以如果我帶著手提音響到你家
So if I had shown up at your house with a boom box

1012
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,590
大放彼得·蓋布瑞爾的音樂
and Peter Gabriel blasting...

1013
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,190
新主人會報警的
The new owners would have called the police.

1014
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,470
對  好的
Right. Okay.

1015
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,760
明顯我們倆是沒有可能了  對嗎
So, clearly this isn't going to happen, right?

1016
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,230
這不關你事  好嗎
Hey, this isn't about you. Okay?

1017
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,610
我一直在處理一堆事情
I've been dealing with a lot of stuff.

1018
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,650
我父母徹底地拋棄了我
My parents completely abandoned me.

1019
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,010
我突然間只能靠自己了
I'm suddenly on my own,

1020
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,520
我還要置辦家具  重新鋪地板
and I had to get furniture, and redo the floors,

1021
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,290
我不知道你有沒有安裝過電器
and I don't know if you've ever set up utilities,

1022
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,140
但是如果你沒有信用卡  就麻煩了
but if you don't have a credit card, it's a problem.

1023
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,360
每次我想到我的公寓和你
And every time I thought about my apartment and you,

1024
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,980
你跟我一起待在我的公寓里
and you in my apartment with me,

1025
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,790
畫面就很奇怪很不和諧
it was weird and confusing.

1026
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,170
我就想"怎么辦  他現在會不會覺得
And I'm like, "what? Is he gonna think

1027
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,200
我在邀請他去一個沒有父母的性愛殿堂"
I'm inviting him over to my big parent free sex palace now?"

1028
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,680
這都快讓我抓狂了
And it freaked me out.

1029
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,590
而且我還要策劃派對  洗生菜
And I had a party to plan and lettuce to wash

1030
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,650
所以我必須故意把你忽略掉
so I had to put you over there in a corner

1031
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,710
因為我現在還沒法處理這事
because I just couldn't deal with it yet.

1032
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,200
你比我想的還要奇怪
You're weirder than I thought.

1033
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,040
而我以為你已經夠奇怪的了
And I thought you were pretty weird.

1034
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,060
我為什么會以為
And why would I just assume

1035
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,610
這里是"性愛殿堂"
that this is a sex palace, huh?

1036
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,720
我連"性愛殿堂"是什么都不知道
I don't even know what the hell a sex palace is.

1037
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,460
別理解錯了  那地方聽上去還不錯
Don't get me wrong, it doesn't sound like a bad thing,

1038
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,800
但我不會只認為
but I wouldn't have just assumed

1039
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,840
這是那種地方
that this is one of them.

1040
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,970
-嘿  -干嘛
- Hey! - What?

1041
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,930
然后呢
So what?

1042
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,540
我們之間什么都不會發生了
This isn't gonna happen?

1043
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,330
天啊  你有病啊
Oh my god, you're nuts.

1044
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,830
你真是瘋了
You're seriously certifiable.

1045
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,110
我一直在給你打電話發短信
I have been calling and texting

1046
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,870
拋開自尊心
and throwing my self-respect out the window

1047
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,220
可以說是在跟蹤你
and basically stalking you,

1048
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,730
而你卻說我只比生菜重要
and you just told me I was outranked by lettuce.

1049
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,100
所以沒錯  看起來
So yeah, it doesn't really seem like

1050
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,350
你真的不想我們之間發生什么
you want this to happen.

1051
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,350
-我想  -真的
- Well, I do. - Oh yeah?

1052
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,480
-沒錯  -什么時候
- Yeah! - Fine. When?

1053
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,560
-周五  -八點
- Friday. - 8:00?

1054
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
-隨便  -很好
- Fine. - Great.

1055
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,770
-再見  -再見
- Bye! - Bye!

1056
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,460
那人怒了沒
Is the man on fire yet?

1057
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,770
我們還沒到
We're not there.

1058
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,060
你繼續睡吧
Go back to sleep.

1059
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,700
這是在哪
Where are we?

1060
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,080
稍微繞了個道  有點事情要處理
Took a little detour. Just have to run a quick errand.

1061
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,340
我馬上回來
I'll be back in a second.

1062
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,460
咋回事  我說讓你在車里待著
What? I told you to stay in the car.

1063
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,410
我想買點薯條吃
I thought I'd get some fries.

1064
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,670
我會給你買的  回車里待著
I'll get you fries. Go back to the car.

1065
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,990
或者買別的東西配薯條吃
I might want something with my fries.

1066
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,610
啥東西  你想買什么配薯條吃

1067
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,020
不知道  更多薯條

回車里待著  我會給你帶
Go back to the car and I'll bring you

1069

你喜歡的吃的
something you'll like.

1070
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,660
到時會給你個驚喜  像游戲那樣
It'll be a surprise. Like a game.

1071
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,430
-你喜歡游戲  -你好奇怪
- You like games. - You're being weird.

1072
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,890
怎么回事  廁所里藏了槍還是咋了
What's going on? Is the gun behind the toilet or something?

1073
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,810
你跟我開玩笑吧
You've got to be kidding me.

1074
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,560
-米歇爾  -你一路開車到

1075

開了二百英里的車來見媽媽

一個我成功地躲了
A woman I've been actively successfully

1081
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,110
12年半的女人
avoiding for 12 1/2 years?

1082
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,770
這事與你無關  我就是要做點事情
This isn't about you. I just have to do something.

1083
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,020

我趕時間  媽

1101
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,250

1102

回車里待著就好了
Just go back to the car.

1103

行了媽  開始吧  行不

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,970
要是你來看我的話你就能住其中一間
so you can stay in one if you ever visit.

1118
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,510
還有間房空出來我要把它變成錄音室
And a bonus room I'm going to turn into my recording studio.

1119
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,560
她的錄音室
Her recording studio?

1120
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,310
我告訴過你我要做張專輯
I told you I was gonna make an album, right?

1121
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,500
她的錄音室
Her recording studio?

1122
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,660
不  你沒說過  你不在這兒
No, you didn't. You're not here.

1123
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,010
我一直想唱歌的
I always wanted to sing.

1124
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,170
魯弗斯有專業工具
And Rufus has pro tools.

1125
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,540
魯弗斯是我的新男友  這你沒問
Rufus is my new boyfriend. You didn't ask.

1126
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,200
他更年輕  沒蘇珊·薩蘭登的男友年輕
He's younger. Not as young as Susan Sarandon's boyfriend,

1127
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,230
不過他比我年輕
but he's younger than me.

1128
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,210

你知道什么有趣  海洋學
You know what's fun? Oceanography.

1134
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,070
-啥  -沒什么
- What? - Nothing.

1135
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,680
就是說  你要買套公寓
So, you're buying a condo.

1136
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,880
沒錯
I am!

1137
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,860
我朋友珍妮
My friend Jenny,

1138
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,120
本來是她看中的房
she was looking at it first.

1139
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,830
她想把空余的房間弄成健身房
She wanted to turn the bonus room into a gym,

1140
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,620
不過作為錄音棚會更好
but it's gonna make a much better recording studio.

1141
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,230
我想我該嘗試鄉村和西部風
I thought I'd try country and western

1142
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,720
因為我戴帽子好看
because I look good in hats.

1143
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,170
白癡的理由  是吧
Silly reason, right?

1144
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:24,900
-是  -不是
- Yes. - No.

1145
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,050

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,480
好陌生的詞
Those are unfamiliar words.

1149
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,020
史考特  告訴仙妮亞·唐恩
Scotty, tell Shania Twain

1150
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,020
美國鄉村音樂天后  諷刺她媽媽

1151
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,130
專心看自己的文件
Eyes on her own paper.

1152
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,690
媽媽  拜托
Mom, please.

1153
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,780
哦對
Oh yes.

1154
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,390
就是些法律條款什么的
It's just your standard legal blah blah blah.

1155
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,960
我沒看見
I don't see where

1156
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,840
監護人的名字應該簽在哪兒
the guardian's signature is supposed to go.

1157
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,930
什么玩意
The what?

1158
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:43,940
我想是簽在這
Right there, I think.

1159
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,260
監護人簽名
The guardian's signature?

1160
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,650
筆沒水了  你有筆嗎
My pen's dead. You got a pen?

1161
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,780
喂喂  監護人簽名  什么監護人簽名
Hello? Guardian signature, what's a guardian signature?

1162
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,420
史考特  史考特  史考特  史考特...
Scotty Scotty Scotty Scotty Scotty Scotty Scotty.

1163
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,670
我是媽媽的監護人
I'm mom's guardian.

1164
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,320
我得為她所有的財務交易簽字  好嗎
I have to sign all her financial transactions, okay?

1165
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,490
我堅決不同意
How many ways can I say no?

1166
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,120
聽著  她遇到麻煩了
Look, she got into a situation.

1167
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,040
真嚇人
That's shocking.

1168
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,480
她和男友買了房子
She bought a house with a boyfriend...

1169
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,370
不是魯弗斯
Not Rufus.

1170
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,100
他本該付一半錢的
And he was supposed to pay half,

1171
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,330
可是他們分手了
but they broke up,

1172
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,610
媽媽不想被房子纏住
and mom didn't want to get stuck with a house.

1173
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,450
要擺脫唯一的辦法就是
But the only way to get her out of it

1174
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,760
宣布她是無行為能力者
was to have her declared incompetent

1175
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,850
這就需要我成為她的監護人
which involved me becoming her guardian.

1176
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,730
你腦子進水了嗎
Are you out of your freaking mind?

1177
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,160
拜托  別管這事
Please, just stay out of this.

1178
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,470
你怎么讓她騙成這樣了
How did you let her con you into this?

1179
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
她必須把房子賣了來買公寓
She had to get rid of the house in order to get the condo.

1180
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,900
為了理解這里瘋狂的一切
I want to make sure I understand the full crazy here.

1181
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,820
她宣布無行為能力
She had herself declared incompetent

1182
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,910
就為了從一個住所脫身
to get out of a place to live

1183
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,520
去住另一個地方
in order to get a different place to live.

1184
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,650
她本來...
Well, she was supposed to...

1185
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,510
等等  還沒到最瘋狂的呢
No. I haven't gotten to the crazy yet.

1186
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,300
她為了從住處脫身
She had herself declared incompetent

1187
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,290
假裝自己沒有行為能力
to get out of a place to live.

1188
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,400
你還幫著她了
And you helped her!

1189
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,850
她絕不能指望我住在那里
She certainly can't expect me to live,

1190
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,050
那里有太多回憶
in a place with so many memories.

1191
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,590
有誰明知道不能長相廝守
Who co-signs on a house

1192
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,570
還和男友一起買房
with a guy they know it's not gonna work out with?

1193
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,580
她不知道會分手
Well, she didn't know that.

1194
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,420
從來沒長久過
It never works out.

1195
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,680
和魯弗斯會的
It will with Rufus.

1196
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,420
史考特  現在和我一起離開這里
Scotty, leave here with me right now.

1197
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,540
先讓我簽了這個
Just let me sign this.

1198
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,940
她會讓你惹上麻煩的
She will get you into trouble.

1199
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,060
她一直在做這種事
'Cause that's what she does.

1200
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,820
她把所有人拉進泥沼里
She drags everyone into her hole of destruction,

1201
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,850
然后不知怎的她脫身了
then somehow she climbs out

1202
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,440
-把你留在那里  -好生動
- and leaves you there. - So dramatic.

1203
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,890
也許你該成為鄉村歌手
Maybe you should be the country singer.

1204
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,790
媽媽給我打電話需要幫助
Mom called me and needed help.

1205
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,930
那我該怎么做
What was I supposed to do?

1206
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,050
經常換電話號碼
Change your number a lot.

1207
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,140
我就是這么做的
That's what I do.

1208
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,570
說得像我要打給她似的
She acts like I call her.

1209
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,050
我才沒那么可憐呢  我有朋友
I'm not that desperate. I have friends.

1210
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,270
我在錄制唱片
I'm making a record.

1211
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,600
真搞不懂現在關她什么事
I don't see how it's any of her business anyhow.

1212
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,540
她12年來從不關心
She hasn't cared for 12 years.

1213
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,800
12年半
12 1/2.

1214
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,810
我不明白現在就關她什么事了
I don't know why it matters to her now.

1215
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,850
簽好了媽媽
There, mom.

1216
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,290
拿著
Take it.

1217
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,460
米歇爾
Michelle?

1218
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,580
只是想看看你的臉
I just wanted to see your face.

1219
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:37,310
上門服務
Well, door-to-door service

1220
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,280
請給我小費
and I do accept gratuities.

1221
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,750
你不可能永遠不和我說話
You can't freeze me out forever.

1222
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,970
我可以
Yes, I can.

1223
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,740
但是我不會
But I won't.

1224
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,930
我該走了
I should get going.

1225
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,610
下回結婚前先告訴我一聲
Give me some warning before you get married again.

1226
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,100
通常情況下  不會過太久的
There's usually not that much time.

1227
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,030
我明天再回自己家睡
I'll sleep at my place tomorrow.
