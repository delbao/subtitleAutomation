the night
that she was abducted?

179
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,711
He called me.

180
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:31,781
He said he was on his
way home from work.

181
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:36,719
He just needed to stop off
and close up a deal.

182
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:39,621
He didn't have anything
in his schedule for that night.

183
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,791
Do you have any idea
what that deal was?

184
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:47,028
After work, she said she always
liked to go on long walks.

185
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:50,064
She was always
going on about the architecture,

186
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:52,133
how it's nothing
like Oregon.

187
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:54,802
She had just moved
to San Francisco?

188
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,837
Are there any other friends
of hers that you know

189
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:58,105
who we should talk to?

190
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:01,074
She was paying her way
through school.

191
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:05,145
When she wasn't there,
she was always at another job.

192
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,247
Just trying
to stay afloat.

193
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:08,649
You know?

194
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:10,850
If you think of anything else,

195
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:14,888
please, don't hesitate to call.

196
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:20,160
If these victims are
connected, I can't see it.

197
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,195
It's got to be
about the blood.

198
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:23,363
Yeah, but even that's
different.

199
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:25,198
Gary was A-positive,
Pam was O-neg.

200
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:28,134
We just got the lab report back
on the latest victim, Lynn Stevens.

201
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:29,835
She was AB-negative.

202
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:32,104
Maybe these are just
victims of opportunity.

203
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,521
Well, it's possible the
unsub abducted Pamela on

204
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,008
one of her routine walks.

205
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:40,079
He could have lured Gary with
the promise of a lucrative money deal.

206
00:11:52,324 --> 00:11:55,026
Hi. I'm Aimee.

207
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:58,095
Nice place.

208
00:11:58,163 --> 00:12:01,498
Okay, so it's going to be
75 for the hour.

209
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:04,168
Anything more than that
we can discuss.

210
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:05,635
All right?

211
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:07,337
Someplace where
I can get changed?

212
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:09,339
There.

213
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:11,841
I don't know which positions
you want me in,

214
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:14,077
but I'm very flexible.

215
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:23,186
What's up, baby girl?

216
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:24,720
I'm worried about Reid.

217
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:25,988
I am, too.

218
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:27,223
What do you think
he's doing?

219
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,592
I think he's taking the time
that Hotch gave him.

220
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:31,659
I get it. He's sad.
He should be sad.

221
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:33,027
But I'm so worried.

222
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:35,464
And when someone I love
is hurting,

223
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:38,567
it's like I hurt, too, which I know
is super codependent,

224
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,969
but it's just how I roll, and I feel
like I should be doing something,

225
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:42,770
and I don't know
what it is, but--

226
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,272
All right, slow down,
all right? Just slow down.

227
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,707
Could you call him?

228
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:48,476
I have. He's just not ready
to talk to anybody right now.

229
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:52,079
I need to hear his voice.
It's impairing my ability to work.

230
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,881
Let me try something,
all right?

231
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:56,984
Thanks.

232
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:00,454
Hello. This is Spencer Reid.
Please leave a message.

233

[Beep]

234
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:04,190
Hey, Reid, it's Derek. Listen,
I got a work question for you.

235
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:07,059
The unsub's exsanguinating victims
and removing their eyelids antemortem.

236
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:09,596
Does that mean anything
to you? Hit me back.

237
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,298
[Door opens]

238
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:15,468
Here's the information
you called about.

239
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:16,536
Thank you.

240
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:19,438
[Cell phone rings]

241
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,307
Excuse me for a second.

242
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,909
What's up, Reid?

243
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:27,712
Have the cornea or pupils
been harmed in any way?

244
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,849
No, no. Blake said it looked like a very
sharp instrument was used.

245
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,318
If he's taking care
not to damage the eyes,

246
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:36,320
then line of sight is probably
what's important to him.

247
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:39,824
So this guy wants them
to see what he's doing.

248
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:45,664
Hey, Reid. How are you?

249
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:48,299
I gotta go.

250
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:56,273
Sorry about that.

251
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,641
Not a problem.

252
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:00,243
Cause of death would
definitely be exsanguination.

253
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:01,985
But the tox screen
showed high levels of--

254
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:05,639
say this 5 times fast--
ethylene diamine tetra acetic.

255
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:07,416
EDTA. It's an anti-coagulant.

256
00:14:07,484 --> 00:14:10,352
Used mostly to treat
heart conditions.

257
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,989
So the unsub probably
used it to thin the blood.

258
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:14,991
The ketamine we found
may have helped as well.

259
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:17,093
In humans, it tends
to elevate blood pressure.

260
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:18,695
Which is how
he's sedating them.

261
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:21,530
If he knew that he was giving
these drugs to these victims

262
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:23,098
and he ingested the blood?

263
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,666
He'd be dosing himself
as well.

264
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,902
Well, that rules out vampirism.

265
00:14:26,969 --> 00:14:29,071
Is there any chance this guy works
in the medical field?

266
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:31,740
I doubt it. There are a few
hesitation marks near the wound,

267
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:34,710
and the hole in the artery
shows a lot of bruising around it.

268
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:36,011
I'd say
it's amateur at best.

269
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,913
All right,
so we got an unsub

270
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,014
who's picking his victims
at random,

271
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:41,949
sedates them,
then bleeds them dry.

272
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:46,854
If he's not drinking the blood,
what the hell is he doing with it?

273
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:07,373
Wait...

274
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:08,708
Wait...

275
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:09,843
[Breathing hard]

276
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,277
Shh, shh, shh. Be still.

277
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,046
What's--what--
what are you doing?

278
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,648
Wait--wait--aah!

279
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,226
Well, we got a hit
off the prints.

280
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:35,829
The victim's name
is Aimee Fortner.

281
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:40,534
It's only been a day
since his last kill.

282
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,169
Well, this guy doesn't
have a cool-down period.

283
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:44,938
Rigor hasn't set in yet.

284
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:47,640
I'd say she was put here
maybe an hour ago,

285
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,007
just after sunrise.

286
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:50,242
He's getting brazen.

287
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,910
It's his first daytime
disposal.

288
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:54,714
Well, this part of the park's
not very well traveled.

289
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:56,849
The city's been trying
to renovate every couple of years,

290
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,617
but you know--politics.

291
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:01,019
So the unsub is familiar
enough with the area

292
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,054
to know nobody would
disturb him.

293
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:05,590
Office of omnipotence.
How may I dazzle you?

294
00:16:05,658 --> 00:16:08,626
Garcia, I need information
on the latest victim, Aimee Fortner.

295
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:11,629
Information is my favorite
way to dazzle, sir.

296
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:12,964
So sparkly.

297
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:14,866
Here we go
Aimee Crystal Fortner.

298
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,300
Originally from Santa Clara.

299
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:17,569
She was super pretty.

300
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:19,603
When she wasn't bartending,
she supplemented her income

301
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:21,538
by modeling.

302
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,939
A model?

303
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,842
Yes. And she's
got a website

304
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:27,811
full of very artistic
pictures of herself.

305
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:31,815
Girl was not afraid to flaunt
what God gave her at all.

306
00:16:31,883 --> 00:16:34,517
Uh-huh.
Thanks, Garcia.

307
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,789
What are you thinking?

308
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:45,728
Reid told Morgan
line of sight

309
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,565
was important to the unsub.

310
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:56,772
We should take a look
at the other crime scenes.

311
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:59,408
I might know what he's
doing with the blood.

312
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:09,250
We believe that this unsub
is a white male in his 20s or 30s,

313
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:12,753
and he thinks of himself
as a painter or an artist.

314
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:16,490
The placement of the
victims tells us a lot about who he is.

315
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,193
Pamela Hurd was found
near a painting done by

316
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:21,595
little known San Francisco artist
Henry Floyd.

317
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,131
Gary Porter was posed near
a piece of graffiti art

318
00:17:24,198 --> 00:17:27,401
by a street artist named Cypher, who is
currently wanted by the police.

319
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,702
Hotch: And the third victim, Lynn Stevens,
was found near a mural

320
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,271
painted by inner city youths.

321
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:35,242
Finally, Aimee Fortner was placed
near the statue of Saint Luke,

322
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,144
patron Saint of the artist.

323
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:39,111
JJ: This is a compulsion.
It's not accidental.

324
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,746
He is obsessed with art.

325
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:42,598
Rossi: All of the works
of art are neglected,

326
00:17:42,623 --> 00:17:44,566
ignored, cast aside.

327
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,318
It's how he feels
about himself.

328
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:47,973
Hotch: We believe it's also
the reason that he's evolved

329
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:49,557
to removing the victims eyelids.

330
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:52,139
He's forcing them to see
what he sees.

331
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:54,275
There's no sexual component
with these murders,

332
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:57,378
but that's because the blood
and the use of the blood

333
00:17:57,445 --> 00:17:58,912
is his sexual release.

334
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,313
So, wait.

335
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:02,516
What--what is he doing
with the blood?

336
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:04,084
Because he's so obsessed
with art,

337
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,819
we believe
he's painting with it.

338
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,654
Rossi: He has a quick
kill pace.

339
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:09,322
More blood means more paint.

340
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:11,491
The more paintings he does,

341
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,494
the greater the chance
someone will recognize his work.

342
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,396
We think that because
of his need for acceptance,

343
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:18,163
he may be trying
to sell the paintings.

344
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,999
So focus your canvassing
on places

345
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,802
that might sell
this kind of fringe art.

346
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,320
[Cell phone rings]

347
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,388
What's up, kid?

348
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,956
If it is about the art,

349
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,658
then it's clear the disposal
sites are scattered

350
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,727
around the Mission
District area.

351
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,729
Wait a minute.
How did you know--

352
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,097
I had Anderson bring over
some of the files.

353
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:57,067
All right. All right, hold on a second.
Let me patch in Garcia.

354
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:59,702
[Dialing]

355
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,304
What have you heard?
Is he okay?

356
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:03,139
Slow down. Slow down.

357
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:05,508
Reid.

358
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:06,609
Garcia, you should pull a list

359
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:08,912
of all the art galleries
in San Francisco.

360
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:12,248
Reid, I was just--

361
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:14,383
how are you?

362
00:19:14,451 --> 00:19:15,651
Better.

363
00:19:15,718 --> 00:19:18,053
Thanks for asking.

364
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,988
And thanks for the baskets.

365
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:22,190
You know, nuts have magnesium,
which helps produce--

366
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:24,893
Serotonin. Yeah.
I know.

367
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:29,932
Okay, galleries.
I got a lot.

368
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:32,800
Focus on the Mission District.

369
00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:37,605
I guess that's better
than nothing.

370
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:39,474
It is. I will take it.

371
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,977
Okay, there's still a few galleries,
but it's more manageable.

372
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:44,684
I am sending the addresses
to your mobile.

373
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:47,213
I got it. Thanks, Garcia.

374
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:48,615
Yeah.

375
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,560
It's an original Hellman.

376
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:04,658
He painted it while
literally on his deathbed.

377
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:07,666
10,000.

378
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:09,935
Mm-hmm.

379
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:11,036
Mm-hmm.

380
00:20:11,104 --> 00:20:12,538
Yeah?
Madison.

381
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:14,907
He's back.

382
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,210
The museum is ready
to make me an offer.

383
00:20:18,277 --> 00:20:19,377
Perfect.

384
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:21,278
If you want,
I can tell him to leave.

385
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,048
No, it's okay.

386
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,519
Mrs. Riley.

387
00:20:27,586 --> 00:20:31,389
I think you'll be much more
pleased with my piece this time.

388
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,327
Yeah, um, like I told you
the last time,

389
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:40,163
I'm not interested.

390
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,967
Why not?

391
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,669
Well, because
this type of art

392
00:20:45,737 --> 00:20:48,204
is just not what
we're looking for.

393
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:52,775
Well, what is it
you are looking for?

394
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:55,512
Uh...

395
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:57,680
Look, I can see that
you're getting better.

396
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:03,253
All I can tell you
is it's a little simplistic.

397
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,323
Look, every good artist leaves
a piece of himself on the canvas.

398
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:10,092
You have to find
that one thing

399
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,328
that's going to set you apart from
the rest of the crowd.

400
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:15,830
I used blood.

401
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:19,801
An unusual medium is not
what I'm talking about.

402
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:25,740
The world today
doesn't make sense.

403
00:21:25,808 --> 00:21:28,743
Why should I paint
pictures that do?

404
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:30,444
Picasso.

405
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:33,647
I'm impressed.

406
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:39,152
If I find my signature, you'll
consider me for the gallery?

407
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,655
Anything's possible.

408
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:45,758
Yeah.

409
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,927
Thank you.

410
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,207
Can I help you?

411
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:02,407
We're from the FBI.

412
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:03,475
You the owner?

413
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:05,176
Yeah. Name's Tre.

414
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:09,014
Do you have any art on display
where blood is used as a medium?

415
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:11,016
No.

416
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:14,019
No, but there was a guy
in here a couple days ago

417
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:15,487
who tried to sell me
a piece like that.

418
00:22:15,554 --> 00:22:17,889
It wasn't exactly my taste,

419
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:19,857
but a customer of mine
happened to be in here,

420
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:23,161
saw it, fell in love with it,
bought it on sight.

421
00:22:24,396 --> 00:22:26,664
You think that
could that be your guy?

422
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:29,033
You wouldn't happen to have any
security cameras in here, would you?

423
00:22:29,101 --> 00:22:30,868
No.

424
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:32,570
We need the customer's
name if you've got it.

425
00:22:32,638 --> 00:22:34,338
Yeah.

426
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:54,323
I never quite understood
these things.

427
00:22:54,391 --> 00:22:57,293
It all looks like the guy had
a seizure while painting it.

428
00:22:57,361 --> 00:23:00,496
It's Emile Hartford.

429
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:03,633
It's early 20th century.

430
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,668
His daughter died
when she was 8.

431
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:09,204
He said every time he painted,
he'd be able to see her.

432
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:12,174
Don't know how you see
anything in there.

433
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,379
I guess that's why they say
art is in the eye of the beholder.

434
00:23:18,947 --> 00:23:21,183
Yeah.

435
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,250
You know what else
is in the eye of the beholder?

436
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,053
'57 Chevy I told you
about last week?

437
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,789
This morning, bam,
it won't start.

438
00:23:28,856 --> 00:23:31,858
Now it's in the eye
of my mechanic.

439
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,831
Come on, man, are you
gonna make me ask

440
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:41,167
or are you gonna be a friend
and offer me a ride home?

441
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:46,706
We're friends.

442
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:49,842
Worked together for two years
now. I'd hope so.

443
00:23:55,515 --> 00:23:58,950
You need a ride, Paul?

444
00:23:59,018 --> 00:24:03,255
Thought you'd never ask.

445
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,362
The unsub sold his
painting to this place?

446
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,098
It reminds me
of the eighties.

447
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:16,701
What?

448
00:24:16,768 --> 00:24:19,837
Do I even want to know?

449
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:21,639
Probably.

450
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:30,913
Welcome. My name is Andre.

451
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:33,116
Before we start, I'll need you
to fill out a small waiver.

452
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:34,784
No, no, no.
We're not a couple.

453
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:37,621
That's okay. We cater
to all kinds of relationships.

454
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:38,888
Well, uh, our relationship

455
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:41,891
is with the FBI.

456
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:45,227
Oh.

457
00:24:45,295 --> 00:24:47,263
I run a clean
establishment here.

458
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,265
Clean, legal, adult fun.

459
00:24:49,332 --> 00:24:52,934
Calm down. We're just looking
for a painting you bought recently.

460
00:24:53,002 --> 00:24:54,536
You're gonna have to be
a bit more specific.

461
00:24:54,604 --> 00:24:57,105
I'm a connoisseur
of the dark and depraved arts.

462
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:59,574
I purchase a lot of paintings.

463
00:24:59,642 --> 00:25:01,242
Well, you bought this one
a couple of days ago.

464
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,510
It's made with blood.

465
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:04,211
Human blood.

466
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,913
Like I said, I buy
a lot of paintings.

467
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:07,415
I don't remember them all.

468
00:25:07,483 --> 00:25:10,485
Oh, really? Because
last I checked,

469
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:13,488
withholding evidence
would make you an accomplice.

470
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,054
We just want to see
the painting.

471
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:19,259
Just want to see if it's from
the guy we're looking for.

472
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,729
Remembering now?

473
00:25:22,797 --> 00:25:24,665
Possibly.

474
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:30,504
For that piece, you'll have to
follow me to the spanking room.

475
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,439
I may have bought it,
but I didn't realize

476
00:25:33,473 --> 00:25:36,375
it was evidence
of any sort.

477
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:38,978
Is that that
you're looking for?

478
00:25:41,816 --> 00:25:45,418
The tortured look in her eyes
is what first drew me to it.

479
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:49,855
The guy was asking 1,500 for it.
I got him to take 250, cash.

480
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:52,624
That's our first victim,
Pamela Hurd.

481
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:55,294
It's definitely from our guy.

482
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:58,030
Yeah, we're gonna need
to take this.

483
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:10,808
[Muttering]

484
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:13,044
What are you doing?

485
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:16,881
What...

486
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:19,349
What...

487
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,351
What's going on?

488
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:25,222
It...

489
00:26:25,323 --> 00:26:27,457
Wawa.

490
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:29,826
What--

491
00:26:30,895 --> 00:26:33,730
no, please don't.

492
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:37,233
Why?

493
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:42,137
It's the only way.

494
00:26:42,205 --> 00:26:43,939
Sorry.

495
00:26:44,007 --> 00:26:45,741
You're insane.

496
00:26:46,776 --> 00:26:48,978
I guess every artist
is a little crazy.

497
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:50,945
No, come on man,
we're friends.

498
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,780
Exactly.

499
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:57,818
It's what I've been missing.
Something personal.

500
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:03,557
I need you to hold still.

501
00:27:05,861 --> 00:27:07,961
Hold still.

502
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:10,497
Hold still..

503
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:11,831
Hold still!

504
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,400
Help!

00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:14,401
[Grunting]

506
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:17,437
No! Aah!

507
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:20,740
No!

508
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,079
No...No!

509
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:45,072
Well, we now have
a piece of his art,

510
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,508
but we still don't have
anything to identify the unsub.

511
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:49,810
The lab's got a sample, but it's
probably Pamela Hurd's blood.

512
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:52,546
Master Andre said he was
an average white guy

513
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:54,281
in his late 20s
to early 30s.

514
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:57,083
Same thing the gallery owner said.
He signed it.

515
00:27:57,151 --> 00:28:01,622
Yeah, it looks like
a "B" something or something "B".

516
00:28:01,689 --> 00:28:04,024
I'm going to have Garcia
compile a list of artists

517
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:06,126
with the letter "B"
somewhere in their name.

518
00:28:06,193 --> 00:28:09,296
It's not much,
but it's something.

519
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,674
We got the report back
from the lab.

520
00:30:07,742 --> 00:30:09,676
They couldn't extract
any DNA from the painting.

521
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:12,712
They said something about there
only being red blood cells.

522
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,548
Hmm. He removed
the white blood cells.

523
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:16,882
Plasma.

524
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,251
Why would he take
the plasma?

525
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,219
It would make it thicker.
Easier to use as a paint.

526
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,388
What type of equipment
would it take to do that?

527
00:30:23,456 --> 00:30:26,091
You can easily buy
a centrifuge online these days

528
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,502
for a couple hundred
bucks.

529
00:30:27,602 --> 00:30:29,132
What other reasons would
he have for separating

530
00:30:29,157 --> 00:30:30,529
the plasma from the blood?

531
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,664
It's a habit.

532
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,967
- Reid.
- Spence.

533
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,476
I didn't expect you back this soon.
You sure you're ready?

534
00:30:44,544 --> 00:30:47,844
No, but I think
I figured something out.

535
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,324
Where's Mrs. Riley?

536
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:01,258
You need to leave.

537
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,925
It's okay, Alan,
I'll handle it.

538
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:07,430
I did what you said.

539
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:11,934
This is my friend, Paul.

540
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,609
I even used
some of my own blood.

541
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,512
That's not what I meant.

542
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:26,682
But you said if I made it
more personal,

543
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,051
you'd use me
in your gallery.

544
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:33,823
Look, I've been trying to be nice
and give you some encouragement,

545
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,991
but I can see now that that's
really not gonna help you.

546
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:38,960
So I think I just
have to be blunt.

547
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:41,529
It's not good.

548
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:45,233
But...

549
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,468
This is--

550
00:31:47,536 --> 00:31:49,403
this is abstract.

551
00:31:49,471 --> 00:31:50,738
I understand the concept,

552
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:52,673
but splashing something
onto a canvas,

553
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:54,675
that doesn't make it art.

554
00:31:54,743 --> 00:32:00,213
Some people have it,
some people don't.

555
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:04,351
You don't know
what you're talking about.

556
00:32:04,418 --> 00:32:07,353
Maybe not, but that still doesn't mean
that I'm gonna buy this.

557
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,788
But you said--

558
00:32:08,856 --> 00:32:10,322
Look, I don't know how
to explain this to you any better.

559
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,893
There is a difference
between a dream and a talent.

560
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:20,332
Look, I'm sorry.

561
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,834
If there's someone
that you--

562
00:32:29,842 --> 00:32:31,710
He's a hemophiliac.

563
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:35,013
That would explain
his obsession with blood.

564
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:37,615
He can't bleed without
a fear of dying.

565
00:32:37,684 --> 00:32:40,084
It's also why he would
separate the plasma from the blood

566
00:32:40,152 --> 00:32:41,451
before painting with it.

567
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,620
It's an antiquated treatment,
but some hemophiliacs

568
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:45,522
can inject plasma
into their wounds,

569
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,359
kick-starting the clotting process
that's ineffective in their own systems.

570
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:50,828
Talk about it.

571
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:54,131
Hey, girlie, I need a list of
hemophiliacs in San Francisco.

572
00:32:54,199 --> 00:32:57,100
Vague. So vague. Okay.

573
00:32:57,168 --> 00:32:59,335
Garcia, for his obsession
to be this profound,

574
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:01,738
he most likely has the more
severe version of the disease.

575
00:33:01,806 --> 00:33:04,040
It's type B Christmas disease.

576
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:07,343
Reid, happy to hear
you made it safe and sound.

577
00:33:07,411 --> 00:33:08,745
Thank you, Garcia.

578
00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:11,847
Okay, Christmas disease.
It does not sound very jolly.

579
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:14,235
It was named after the first known case,
Stephen Christmas.

580
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,186
All right, I got 15 people
who have trouble clotting.

581
00:33:17,253 --> 00:33:19,013
He wouldn't stray too
far from the art world.

582
00:33:19,022 --> 00:33:20,522
Most likely works in and
around the art community,

583
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:21,556
but not as an artist.

584
00:33:21,557 --> 00:33:23,491
And he's a loner.
So look for people with jobs

585
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:25,761
where they don't interact
with the public.

586
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:27,395
Yeah. Yeah. I got 3.

587
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,698
Stock boy at a local
supermarket, an art blogger,

588
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:30,732
and a custodian.

589
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,934
The victims have
different blood types.

590
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:36,438
If he's taking the plasma
out of the blood,

591
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:38,440
he must be
a universal recipient.

592
00:33:38,507 --> 00:33:40,675
Any of them
with AB-positive blood?

593
00:33:40,743 --> 00:33:43,510
Specificity. I dig it.

594
00:33:43,578 --> 00:33:47,514
Okay, if I factor in those "B" names
I was working on...

595
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:49,182
And bingo is his name-o.

596
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:51,218
Actually, his name
is Bryan Hughes.

597
00:33:51,286 --> 00:33:53,220
He is an AB-positive
hemophiliac

598
00:33:53,288 --> 00:33:55,422
who works as a janitor
at the Bay Area Museum of Art,

599
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,090
and before you ask, yes, his
address has been sent to your phones.

600
00:33:58,092 --> 00:33:59,392
You're the best,
baby girl.

601
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,860
Dave, you and Blake
take the museum.

602
00:34:00,894 --> 00:34:03,529
The rest of us
will take the residence.

603
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,067
I'm okay.

604
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:11,036
Yeah. But it's good
to see you.

605
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:15,174
You really don't need to be here
if you're not ready.

606
00:34:15,242 --> 00:34:17,175
This is going to
take time.

607
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,447
How much time?

608
00:34:22,515 --> 00:34:24,949
It's hard to say.

609
00:34:25,017 --> 00:34:27,118
But we're all here
for you.

610
00:34:28,488 --> 00:34:30,121
Thank you.

611
00:35:33,245 --> 00:35:36,181
[sirens]

612
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:38,434
Hey, what you got, mama?

613
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:41,237
A compelling piece of information
about this Bryan Hughes.

614
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:42,371
3 weeks before
the first murder,

615
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:44,006
he was involved
in a car accident.

616
00:35:44,073 --> 00:35:45,206
Hotch:
Was he injured?

617
00:35:45,274 --> 00:35:47,109
Uh, no. And if you were
looking at the pictures I am

618
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:48,644
you would say
that is a miracle.

619
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:51,613
It may have given him
the impression he couldn't be hurt.

620
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:54,683
The other driver was hurt.
She bled to death.

621
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:57,185
Hughes called 911, failed to mention there
was another driver involved.

622
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:58,520
By the time emergency
crews got there,

623
00:35:58,587 --> 00:36:00,027
thanks, Garcia.
She had already died.

624
00:36:00,088 --> 00:36:03,858
Watching the other woman bleed
to death must have been the trigger.

625
00:36:03,925 --> 00:36:05,726
[Cell phone rings]
Hey, what you got, pretty boy?

626
00:36:05,794 --> 00:36:07,628
I think Hughes may have
his next victim.

627
00:36:07,696 --> 00:36:10,564
An Alan archer just came in
and reported his boss missing.

628
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:13,367
Madison Riley owns
an art gallery in the Mission District.

629
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,335
Said there was blood,
signs of a struggle.

630
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:17,571
Hughes even left a painting
of his on the wall this time.

631
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,739
It's the same signature
and it's definitely made of blood,

632
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:23,410
which got me thinking
about Maeve's stalker.

633
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:26,146
If this guy's a tortured artist
searching for approval,

634
00:36:26,214 --> 00:36:28,848
in his mind there may be
only one way to get it.

635
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:30,517
Suicide.

636
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:33,252
Thanks, Reid.

637
00:36:41,995 --> 00:36:45,565
I put my heart and my soul
into those paintings.

638
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:51,436
You're going to get
a first-hand look

639
00:36:51,504 --> 00:36:54,472
at what I'm capable
of creating.

640
00:36:57,976 --> 00:36:59,344
Bryan Hughes, FBI.

641
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:02,314
No! I have to make her see.

642
00:37:03,248 --> 00:37:05,583
Hotch:
Put down the knife.

643
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:11,488
Bryan, I understand.

644
00:37:11,556 --> 00:37:12,989
No, you don't.

645
00:37:13,057 --> 00:37:15,492
How could you possibly
understand?

646
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,794
Because I've seen
your work.

647
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,863
And I know you may not
be appreciated now,

648
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:22,132
but I promise you,
if you put down the knife,

649
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,801
I will make sure that
people see your art,

650
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:27,537
and no one will be
able to ignore it.

651
00:37:27,605 --> 00:37:29,840
It's all I want.
I deserve that.

652
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:34,510
Then put down the knife,
and let's figure this out.

653
00:37:43,686 --> 00:37:47,689
You know how many paintings
van Gogh sold before he died?

654
00:37:47,758 --> 00:37:49,358
Bryan, don't do it.

655
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,994
Two.

656
00:37:53,963 --> 00:37:56,064
He sold two.

657
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:58,466
Don't make us do this.

658
00:38:05,474 --> 00:38:06,975
I gotta make you see me.

659
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:16,016
Get the EMTs upstairs.

660
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:18,685
We've got another body
over here.

661
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:22,823
[Gasping]

662
00:38:57,722 --> 00:39:01,358
Well, I counted 5 baskets.

663
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:03,660
7, but I think
Ms. Cavanaugh next door

664
00:39:03,728 --> 00:39:05,395
may have taken a couple.

665
00:39:06,698 --> 00:39:09,366
I'm really sorry
if I've been kind of...

666
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:13,303
Spence. You don't...

667
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,770
Kid.

668
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:17,240
I didn't mean for you
to come all the way out there.

669
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:19,042
I know.

670
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:22,778
Listen, if you need
anything at all,

671
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:24,613
you just have to ask.

672
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:27,283
Actually, if you guys
don't mind,

673
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:30,819
I could use some help
with something.

674
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:32,620
Name it.

675
00:41:17,956 --> 00:41:21,657
Reid: "Sometimes the hardest
part isn't letting go,

676
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:25,361
but rather, learning
to start over."

677
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:28,597
