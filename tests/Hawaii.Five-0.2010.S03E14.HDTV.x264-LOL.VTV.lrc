Mm. What's the plan for tomorrow?
Debate prep, campaign rally downtown,

[07:21.70]wish we had.
I'm so sorry.
I have to take this call.
[07:31.71]Yes, Governor?
She was found like that in a mansion in Kahala.
[07:39.89]We got an I.D.?
HPD is still working on it.
But here are the preliminaries.
All right. We'll do everything
[07:46.28]we can to help, sir.
I don't want you to help, Commander-- I want you
and your Five-O task force to take over the case.
[07:52.81]And I need it cleared quickly.
Well, uh, HPD Homicide is very good...
And I need it done quietly.
[08:00.16]Yes, sir.
Uh...
if I may ask, what brought this case to your attention?
The people who own the house
[08:07.88]are friends of mine, close friends.
Very dear friends.
I'd like the matter to remain private.
[08:14.84]Okay, well, I'll need to talk to them.
You can't. Why not?
They're trekking in Nepal; completely unreachable.
[08:21.09]I'll need to confirm that, sir. I'm confirming it for you right now.
Keep me in the loop, Commander.
[08:27.18]I want constant updates.
And don't go through the office.
Call my cell directly.
[08:35.44]Understood, sir.
All right, send him in.
[08:42.75]Hold on, let me get this straight.
Is this official business, or is this a favor?
What difference does it make? Well, it makes a very big difference,
[08:49.45]you see, because official business is, uh, official.
A favor is like a quid pro quo kind of deal, right?
[08:55.28]You... solve this murder case for me,
and I will give you, uh, oh, five days' paid vacation.
Right? Or tickets to Monster Truck Jam, or whatever.
[09:03.25]Monster Truck Jam's not in town.
Okay, so then it is, indeed, official business.
Exactly. Exac...? Wh-What...
[09:09.14]None of this seems strange to you?
Hold on. None of this seems, uh, in the slightest bit off?
I mean, what are these homeowners?
[09:15.48]They, uh, big contributors
to the governor's campaign, or what?
I have no idea. And we can't talk to them?
Danny, is there a point coming anytime soon? - Absolutely.
[09:22.40]It seems to me like we're taking a case
just to protect the governor's friends.
With the governor's task force. Then why
does it feel like we are performing janitorial services, blindfolded,
[09:30.58]I might add. We've been given a directive, Danny.
Oh, right, I understand.
When McGarrett gets an order, he takes the order.
[09:37.05]You know what you're like? You're like one
of those windup toy soldiers.
Let me get you a drum for Christmas to beat.
The last time we butted heads with Denning, he sent Lori home.
[09:44.98]I don't want to see what he's got planned for an encore, do you?
[09:50.85]Okay, here are some basics.
The homeowners' names are Wendy and Patrick Duggan.
I checked into their passport records.
[09:56.89]They landed in Katmandu last week.
According to their itinerary, they're halfway into their hike.
Well, confirms what Governor Denning told us.
[10:03.78]How do you think the cell service is on Everest?
I can't imagine it's too good.
We got any signs of forced entry? No.
Other than the Duggans, the caretaker's the only one
[10:10.62]who claims to have a set of keys.
HPD checked his alibi.
It's airtight.
Max give us a COD?
[10:17.01]He hasn't posted the vic yet, but based
on the bruising around her neck, he's thinking she was strangled.
Maybe it was a crime of passion, right?
[10:23.05]Killer's having sex with the vic,
then he gets a little rough,
things spin out of control.
You got anything else?
[10:29.09]Yeah. Max found traces of a powdery substance
around her left clavicle.
He sent it over to Fong for processing.
I got an I.D. on our vic.
[10:37.95]Her name is Serena Andrews.
HPD had her
in their database. What was she cited for?
Solicitation.
[10:47.71]Houston, we've got a problem.
So we have a working girl killed
in a Kahala mansion belonging to good friends of the governor.
Two questions:
[10:54.71]did the governor know her,
and did he know that she was a prostitute?
And if he did,
is he involved?
[11:00.47]You like the way this is going?
No, I don't.
[11:18.98]Serena didn't make it home last night.
Not exactly a big deal.
So she often stays out all night?
[11:25.00]Look, I'm her roommate,
not her mother.
But she is a friend of yours?
Yeah.
How long you guys been here?
[11:32.32]Six months.
Mollie, do you know that Serena was cited for solicitation?
[11:40.76]That was over a year ago.
What about you-- you ever been busted?
I'm a student.
Pretty pricey place.
[11:46.77]Student loans cover this?
I don't like what you're insinuating.
I'm not insinuating; I'm asking.
[11:53.64]What's an all-night trick go for these days-- two, three grand?
What I do with my body is my business.
[11:59.20]And when a body shows up dead,
it's ours.
Oh, my God.
[12:05.85]She was found dead at 3500 Hunukai Street in Kahala.
Do you know that address?
[12:11.04]No.
Truth.
Look, Serena didn't usually work with locals, okay?
[12:19.38]Just high-end tourists or conventioneers.
How did she hook up with the johns?
There's this thing called the Internet.
[12:25.09]Maybe you've heard of it.
Where's your laptop?
[12:35.32]So, if we can find the last john Serena booked,
it could lead back to our killer.
Her clientele
wouldn't use their real names, though, would they?
[12:41.99]Probably not.
Then again, the guys we're dealing with
usually aren't thinking with their heads.
Not the big one anyway. Okay,
[12:48.70]okay, copy that.
Let's just get Serena's laptop over to Fong
and see if he can trace the last IP address.
That could be a while.
[12:55.50]Why?
What's wrong? Black SUV
two cars back-- you see it?
[13:01.01]Oh, hello.
Yeah,
it's been tailing us for the last two miles.
[13:10.38]Yeah, okay, thanks, Max.
Hey.
TOD on Serena Andrews
was between 11:00 and 12:00 last night.
[13:17.26]Max just confirmed that she had sexual intercourse
just prior to the murder.
So there's DNA.
Max just put a rush order on it.
Lab should have some answers any time soon.
[13:24.20]I just got off the phone
with the lab.
Did we get a hit?
I don't know.
You just said you got off the phone with the lab.
[13:31.04]I did, yeah, and they told me they are on strict orders
not to rush the testing.
Orders from whom?
Governor Denning's office.
[13:47.75]SUV's still on us.
[13:59.02]That's three straight lefts.
Doubt they're looking for a parking spot.
How do you want to play it?
Hold on.
[14:11.74]Five-O!
Get out of the car now!
Hey, hey!
[14:21.96]What the hell was all that about?
I don't know, but did you catch the plates?
[14:28.05]"G" ride, yeah, government issue.
[14:35.97]Commander, Commander,
you cannot go in there.
[14:41.81]Am I running this investigation or not?
Give us a minute, please.
[14:52.32]Don't ever do that again.
Why'd you ask me to take over this case
if you're going to interfere?
There is a chain of command here,
[14:59.24]and you're not anywhere near the top.
There is a state vehicle surveilling my team.
Sir, the lab can't process the DNA
[15:06.37]on your orders.
Why are you blocking every move I make?
My orders are not subject to your scrutiny, Commander.
What the hell are you hiding, Governor?
[15:13.34]Just what the hell are you implying?
The dead girl-- you knew she was a prostitute.
The DNA we found on the body--
is it yours? No.
[15:19.90]Is it yours, Governor? No!
No, I did not know the victim was a prostitute,
and no, it is not my DNA.
[15:32.94]I don't know what to believe here, sir.
When I run
[15:38.25]that DNA... who is it going to trace back to?
[15:47.01]Chris Freed.
Congressman Christopher Freed?
[15:53.30]Yes, our soon- to-be senator.
I don't understand.
Politics, Commander, plain and simple.
[16:02.59]Protect your flank at all costs.
Protect your ass is what you mean.
[16:09.40]Chris Freed and I go a long way back.
I told him I'd help out any way I can.
He needed a place in town to stay,
[16:16.62]I knew these party donors who were away,
so I arranged it for him to stay at their house--
the same house Serena Andrews' body was found in.
[16:25.55]Okay, why didn't you tell me the truth
when you handed me the case? Because
a scandal like this could ruin a good man's life
[16:31.67]and his chances of being elected.
You didn't think I was gonna find out?
I was hoping to contain your findings as they came in,
[16:38.31]determine if they were credible.
If they were, act accordingly.
You have to understand,
Chris Freed is a Medal of Honor recipient,
[16:47.18]chairman of the Veteran Affairs Committee.
And now he's a suspect in a homicide investigation.
He is also my friend, Commander.
[16:54.11]We served together.
Of all people, you know what that means.
[17:01.67]And, may I add,
he is also a devoted single father,
[17:07.37]so I wanted to be damn sure
that the facts were straight before we rip his life apart.
[17:13.16]With all due respect...
...we just found a dead prostitute in his bed.
[17:19.33]So I have to ask you-- as his friend,
I have got to ask you...
do you think it's possible
[17:26.01]Congressman Freed could have killed this woman?
[17:32.11]I don't know.
[17:45.71]Okay, you know what we call this
in police work? What?
A complete and total waste of time.
Just listen to me.
Anybody knows where the congressman is,
[17:51.99]it's going to be his press secretary.
He's not gonna tell us anything.
These people lie for a living-- you know that, right?
- This guy. - All right, we got anything over there?
[17:58.81]Excuse me, Josh Lowry?
I'll have to call you back.
Uh, yeah, who are you? Steve McGarrett.
This is Detective Danny Williams.
[18:05.40]We're with Five-O. Hi. Oh.
Hey, we're looking for Congressman Freed.
Yeah, Five-O, thank you guys for coming down,
[18:11.43]and you know the congressman is a huge supporter
of the law enforcement community.
Uh, can we get you guys anything-- coffee or water?
No, we're good, we just want
[18:18.05]a minute with the congressman.
Yeah, you know what?
I-I wish you guys had called.
I could have saved you the trouble.
Due to the accelerated campaign schedule,
[18:25.52]the congressman-- he's, he's wall-to-wall today,
guys, he's very busy.
Very busy.
Yeah, slammed actually,
[18:32.15]but I'm sure I can answer any questions
you guys might have on the issues.
I-I have a question, actually.
Yeah, maybe you could tell us,
[18:38.70]what's the congressman's position
on dead hookers found in his bed?
[18:44.12]Strangled dead hookers.
Um, you know, why don't we, uh,
why don't we speak in private?
[18:51.20]Sure.
No, there's no way.
There's got to be some kind of mistake.
[18:57.49]The congressman would never get involved with a prostitute.
His stand on the exploitation of sex workers is very clear,
and as far as murder goes...
[19:03.84]Let me guess, he's completely against it.
Do you even know the congressman?
Uh, about as much as you can know somebody
[19:09.97]in a 15-second sound bite. Okay.
All I'm saying is, spend ten minutes with the man.
You'd be absolutely convinced
[19:15.94]at how outrageous your accusations are.
Now, if this country had more men like Congressman Freed...
There'd be a chicken in every pot
[19:22.03]and a dead ho in every bed, right?
Look, uh, I've been with him
[19:28.34]since his days in the State House.
Okay?
I'm not saying he's perfect but pretty damn close,
and the mere suggestion
[19:35.74]that he could be possibly involved in something like this
is incredibly insulting to him, to his family,
and to his legacy.
[19:41.52]Okay, that is a, a beautiful speech.
Okay, where is he?
Mr. Lowry,
if the congressman is as big on law enforcement as you say,
[19:49.26]then you understand, we have to do our job.
Now, where is he?
We're not going to ask you again.
[19:56.01]Geez. Ah, boy.
We've been spinning all morning to cover for him.
[20:02.72]Oh, you don't even know where he is?
No, we don't.
You didn't think to tell anybody?
[20:08.41]Look, the political reality is this:
the special election is a nail-biter.
We haven't had any time to campaign.
Now, any little thing could tip the scales.
[20:15.38]Now, if news got out that Freed was off the grid,
yeah, let's just say that'd be bad.
No, no, I'll tell you what'd be bad.
[20:23.12]Bad would be "Breaking News Story:
Congressman Freed, Suspect in a Homicide."
Whoa... Josh,
[20:29.26]level with us.
All right, where do you think he is?
All I can think is that he and Amy are somewhere, holed up,
[20:35.74]prepping for the debate.
Who's Amy?
Amy Davidson-- she's Freed's chief of staff,
one of his closest confidants.
[20:41.63]She runs the campaign.
Well, where is she, Josh?
I don't know, I don't, I really don't.
I'm assuming with him.
[20:51.08]So, if I'm Congressman Freed
in the middle of a special election,
and something goes wrong...
Who's the first person you call?
[20:57.29]My chief of staff Amy Davidson.
Right, so you can get together and plan an alibi.
Any luck pinging the congressman's phone?
No, no signal.
[21:03.38]Okay, well, try Amy's.
Chances are,
we find one, we find the other.
Hey, Steve, hold on, Kono's got something.
You guys aren't gonna believe this. The lab finally
[21:11.50]processed the DNA from the dead girl.
They got a hit.
Congressman Freed?
No. Then who is it?
The match came back
[21:18.06]from the National Database to a Ryan Webb.
He's an associate professor of English from Ohio.
He's in town for a mystery writers convention.
[21:25.82]What's a teacher doing in the system?
He's employed at a state school. They require
DNA for background checks. Uh, the IP address from the hotel
[21:32.36]matched Serena's last appointment.
According to the hotel,
he's scheduled to check out this morning.
[21:52.73]I got it.
Here, here, let me help you with those bags.
What is this? Who are you?
[21:58.84]Five-O. We're extending your stay.
Hope you had a nice visit.
[22:04.69]Please, this is all a colossal mistake.
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.
[22:10.58]A mistake? Well, why don't you help me understand?
Where's the congressman?
Congressman who?
[22:16.00]Congressman Freed of the great state of Hawaii.
Is that supposed to mean something to me?
I...
[22:23.08]Party last night, remember? Mansion in Kahala?
Last night?
Last night, I-I was on an Elmore Leonard panel,
[22:29.08]and a bunch of us went to the room to watch Get Shorty.
Yeah, you left the part out about the dead prostitute.
[22:37.64]What? No. No, no, no.
Obviously, fiction isn't your strong suit, Professor,
'cause we have your DNA,
[22:44.48]and it puts you in bed with the hooker
at the congressman's house.
Look, look, come on.
I'm just an English teacher, okay?
[22:51.37]I don't know anything about a congressman,
and I didn't kill anybody!
Nice wedding ring, by the way.
[22:57.54]How long you been married?
Wait a minute.
Maybe your wife
in Ohio knows where you were last night.
[23:04.67]Let's give her a call, see what she got to say then.
Wait, wait, wait.
[23:11.01]Serena was alive when I left her.
Well, how did you
wind up with the congressman? I didn't.
Okay, the girl and I-- we never left the bar.
[23:18.40]Bar? What bar?
Have you ever been to Lima, Ohio?
I mean, come on.
[23:24.47]This is Hawaii.
I-I just wanted to have fun.
So, I-I found this Web site, and Serena--
she agreed to meet me at the Liki Tiki Lounge.
[23:31.81]Wait a minute. You're telling me you had sex with her
at the bar, is that what you're saying?
When-when she showed up, well...
[23:40.17]...we-we did it in the bathroom.
I've always wanted to do that. Back in Lima...
Then what?
[23:46.59]Then-then she left.
What time was that? About-about 10:00.
What did you do after that?
[23:52.02]I stayed and had a few more drinks. Same bar?
Yeah. No. If you don't believe me,
you can check my credit card, okay?
I ran a tab, and I cashed out at last call.
[24:01.39]Bartender confirms seeing Serena Andrews
leaving the Liki Tiki Lounge around 10:00.
Well, what about Webb?
Credit card checks out. He closed the place.
[24:07.48]Okay, so, 10:00 was the last time anybody saw Serena alive.
Mm-hmm, and with TOD set between 11:00 and 12:00...
There's no way Webb could have killed her.
[24:14.82]We're back to square one.
Not exactly. Just got a call from our friend Josh Lowry.
Looks like Freed's Chief of Staff, Amy Davidson,
[24:20.69]just walked into campaign headquarters.
[24:29.67]Josh, where's Amy Davidson?
She's inside with Powers.
Brad Powers. That's, uh, Freed's opponent. What's he doing here?
[24:37.86]Well, he came by to discuss the ground rules of the debate
with the congressman, I was handling the situation.
Then all of a sudden, Amy shows up.
[24:44.23]Picks up right where she left off,
like nothing even happened.
Did she say where she was? No, she didn't.
She went behind closed doors with Powers,
[24:50.22]they've been in there ever since.
Josh, you disappoint me.
I don't know what kind of campaign you're running here,
[24:58.23]but I don't buy Amy's spin for a minute.
We're not spinning anything, Mr. Powers.
Really? Then what's Five-O doing here?
That's between us and the congressman, sir.
[25:04.84]Yeah, well, when you see him, please ask him
why he blew me off last night without so much as a phone call.
What time were you supposed to meet him? 11:00.
[25:11.76]I've know Chris Freed for 15 years.
He's never pulled a stunt like that.
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding, sir.
[25:18.27]He said he wanted to run a civil campaign,
one with mutual respect and all of that.
This is a hell of a way to show it.
[25:25.19]I don't know what you people are hiding,
but I'm gonna find out, and when I do, so will the press.
Okay.
[25:32.43]We need to speak to Amy now.
Amy?
I got Five-O here. They need to talk to you.
[25:39.57]Miss Davis,
where's Congressman Freed?
I don't know,
[25:45.41]but I think he might have done something terrible.
[25:56.70]Don't you think I'd help you guys if I could?
I just don't know where he is right now.
Okay, so, you-- where have you been?
[26:02.69]I was out... looking for him.
Look, you don't get it.
This is complicated.
Then speak slowly, all right?
[26:08.03]Because I need to understand
why a man like Congressman Freed would risk everything
to get serviced by a prostitute.
To tell you the truth, I brought her to meet the congressman.
[26:17.42]That's a smart move.
Why'd you do that?
Doesn't happen all the time, but he's under a lot of stress,
[26:24.49]and he's a single father,
so he's on his own.
I mean, besides his daughter, there's...
[26:30.47]there's really no one else in his life.
So sometimes he just needs
a little companionship for the evening.
So you're chief of staff and part-time madam for him?
[26:38.22]Come on, the guy's human.
All right, Amy, I have to ask you.
To the best of your knowledge,
has the congressman ever hurt any of the women he's been with?
[26:46.28]Rough stuff doesn't seem to be his thing,
but you know, who knows what goes on behind closed doors?
[26:52.69]Okay, well, something happened last night.
Where did you find Serena Andrews?
Picked her up at a place called the Liki Tiki Lounge,
[26:58.58]and I dropped her off at the mansion in Kahala.
No, you delivered her
to the congressman, like a pizza.
Yes.
[27:04.75]What about the congressman's
11:00 with Powers? Why did he blow that off?
I don't know.
[27:10.04]That's why I went back to the mansion.
But when I got there, he was gone,
and I found the girl in the bed.
And being the pragmatic political operative
[27:17.18]that you are, you decided to go
to the governor instead of the police?
Because I knew they were friends,
and I needed time to think.
[27:23.82]To plan a cover-up.
No!
No. Look, something like this has national repercussions.
[27:29.66]Okay, you need to have a viable strategy.
What time did you pick up Serena Andrews?
9:00, 9:15?
[27:36.20]She was right on time.
Am I under arrest?
Amy might be a good chief of staff,
[27:43.17]but she's a terrible liar.
All right, the professor was shot and now Serena
in a bathroom stall at 9:15.
She didn't leave the bar till 10:00.
[27:49.08]You're right.
If I'm right, then why isn't she under arrest?
'Cause we still have to find the congressman,
and if he's on the run, chances are he's gonna reach out to her.
[27:55.37]So let's sit on her phone,
post a surveillance team at her door.
Exactly, and let Freed come to us.
The thing I want to know is, why is Amy lying?
[28:01.56]What do you got?
That powdery substance Max found on the body?
IR Spectroscopy identified it
[28:07.31]as cornstarch.
Cornstarch? Specifically, the type
used in surgical gloves.
[28:13.24]It makes them easier to pull on and off.
That explains... Why we didn't find any prints
belonging to our killer. That does not sound
like a crime of passion.
[28:20.11]That definitely sounds like the killing was premeditated.
So, why would the congressman plan
on killing a prostitute he just met?
Unless he knew her previously.
[28:26.97]Or there's something we're not seeing here.
Or unless he didn't do it.
So, I traced Amy Davidson's timeline. Guess what?
[28:33.39]Doesn't add up.
Ah, she was lying.
Very shocking. Mm-hmm.
She said she picked up Serena Andrews
[28:39.31]from the Liki Tiki Lounge at 9:15.
But when I ran her credit cards,
it turned out, she was having drinks
at another place called the Ocean Lounge.
[28:45.93]By herself? She bought two rounds.
Two drinks each time.
Who she was with? Josh Lowry,
congressman's press secretary. He confirmed it.
[28:53.18]Said they were having a strategy session.
He also confirmed
that they didn't leave the place together.
According to a bartender I spoke to,
[28:59.45]she left with an unknown male companion.
We need a positive ID on that companion.
It's gonna be tough.
No security footage from the bar.
[29:05.17]I found an ATM camera across the street.
Nice.
Only thing is,
I don't think there's a clear shot of the exit.
[29:11.59]Not so nice.
Okay, easy. What it did give us was a shot
of a police cruiser pulling someone
over near the club entrance.
[29:17.85]Huh. We got a dashboard cam? Yeah, we have a dashboard cam,
and I have
footage coming through right now.
[29:24.61]That's Amy. Freeze,
Kono. Freeze that. Can you push in?
Looks like she's with someone.
[29:33.18]Wow.
It's Wo Fat. He's still on the island.
What the hell is he doing with Amy?
[29:40.57]He's using Amy Davidson to set up Congressman Freed.
Set up for what?
Think about it. Who stands
[29:47.46]to gain if Congressman Freed takes a hard fall?
His opponent, Brad Powers.
Wo Fat
[29:53.37]sees this special election as an opening.
He's on the run, he's got no resources.
What better way to rebuilt your empire
[29:59.31]than to buy a politician?
Right, by discrediting Freed,
Powers definitely gets the Senate seat.
And Wo Fat gets a friend in Washington.
[30:05.18]Quid pro quo.
Not on our watch.
[30:23.36]You need to start writing.
Go to hell.
[30:29.34]I expected a more dignified response
from a congressman.
Cut me loose, and I'll show you how dignified I can can be
[30:35.84]when I pound the crap out of you.
You're not thinking this through.
[30:44.75]Why should I sign the equivalent of a suicide note?
That'd be the end of my career, my life.
[30:50.93]Even if I sign it, you're going to kill me anyway.
A homegrown treasure like you?
[30:56.31]A bona fide war hero?
No.
I have too much respect for your accomplishments.
[31:04.24]However...
my affections
don't extend to your daughter.
[31:18.45]Where is he?
Excuse me?
Wo Fat. Where is he? We know you left the bar with him.
Okay, you need to leave.
[31:25.34]I don't think you understand who you're dealing with.
No, I said, you need to leave.
Everything you've said
up to this point is a lie.
All right, the congressman with prostitutes,
[31:31.95]you bringing 'em to him, all of it.
Okay, I can't talk to you guys about this right now.
Get this through your head, okay?
[31:37.81]If Freed's not dead already, Wo Fat will kill him.
You understand what I'm saying?
You can stop this.
[31:43.16]You can stop all of this, but you have to start talking to us.
Where is Congressman Freed?
Where is he, Amy?
Huh?
[31:50.42]What are you doing?
Don't shush me. What are you doing?
[32:07.55]I'm sorry.
I did it because he said he was gonna kill me.
[32:13.22]Listen to me,
where is he keeping the congressman hostage?
I don't know!
- Amy... - I really don't know.
[32:19.70]Get down. Amy, get down!
[32:27.27]I don't see him, Steve.
Everybody, get down! Get down! Get down! Get down!
[33:07.24]There goes our lead to the congressman.
What is that?
Wo Fat?
[33:17.17]Hey, Chin, we need a trace right away.
[33:31.80]I'm sorry, Congressman.
Looks like there's been a change in plans.
[34:16.60]Geez, brah. You scared me.
I thought you was a pig.
[35:15.19]Think of how much easier this could've been
if you had just signed that letter.
[35:35.01]Get lower to the ground!
[35:50.58]Come on, come on. Go closer!
[35:56.28]Grab his leg!
Come on!
[36:02.45]Come on!
[36:11.18]He's hit! Let's go! Come on!
How bad is it?
Bad! We need a hospital right now! Go!
Wo Fat, Danny! Forget it, let's go!
[36:19.05]Forget it!
[36:28.71]Let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
[36:53.37]♪
[37:24.12]So, how's the congressman?
No major organs were hit, just soft tissue damage.
He's gonna be all right. All right.
[37:31.09]What about Wo Fat?
The entire department is searching the jungle.
Got a perimeter set up,
helicopter in the air, everything.
[37:37.38]You find anything in the abandoned house?
Yeah, a cell phone.
Wo Fat left it-- must've been in a rush
to chase down the congressman. And judging
[37:43.89]by the call log, looks like we were right.
He was trying to buy himself a powerful ally.
[37:53.82]Hey!
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so mu...
[38:01.61]Nice to see you again, Mr. Powers.
Relax. What the hell
[38:07.11]are you doing?
Bad taste in friends, buddy.
Bradley Powers,
you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder.
[38:29.57]♪
[38:52.42]Would you please stop?
Please? We didn't have a choice.
We had to let Wo Fat go.
[38:58.43]And we are going to find him. I promise.
Okay?
You mind if I join you guys?
[39:05.19]Hey. Of course, Governor.
Sit, sit. We're not on the clock.
Oh, uh, I got to take this. Sit down, please.
[39:12.39]Your brand?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
[39:18.03]What's the occasion?
Powers cracked under questioning.
Huh. He admitted he was in bed
[39:25.36]with Wo Fat.
Really? Yeah.
He almost
[39:31.46]pulled that one off, huh?
I owe you.
[39:37.25]No, sir.
Just doing the job.
No.
You went above and beyond, Commander.
[39:43.89]And...
I'm sorry.
Sir?
[39:50.53]I should've been straight with you from the start.
Trust-   it, um...
[39:57.19]Well, it's a mighty big word.
[40:03.79]Yeah, it is.
And if I may...
Of course. I'm sitting in shorts,
[40:09.80]drinking beer with you.
All right, fire away and don't hold back.
[40:15.47]I got a lot of respect for you, sir.
Got a lot of respect for the office.
But if this thing between us
[40:22.15]is gonna work out then...
honesty is the best policy.
Your predecessor, she didn't believe in that and, uh...
[40:29.39]well, it got her killed.
Well...
[40:36.50]that was her. This is me.
To Five-O.
[40:42.28]All right.
[40:49.96]Hey. Hey.
Uh...
You all good?
[40:57.88]Uh...
she's not moving.
Grace? The judge
ruled in my favor-- shared custody.
[41:06.02]She cannot leave the island.
She cannot leave the island. Huh?
Huh?
[41:12.53]Congratulations.
Thank you, buddy.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Hey. Thank you.
[41:20.04]Uh, the judge said
that your courtroom behavior was completely unacceptable
Oh, come on. and despicable, but she also said that you were
[41:26.78]a fantastic character witness, so thank you very much.
You're welcome. I'll remind you of that later.
[41:32.05]I'm sure you will.
Well done, gentlemen.
I can't believe I'm actually happy to be staying here.
[41:38.79]Neither can I.
To Hawaii.
To Hawaii.
[41:44.35]To, uh...
[41:50.76]To Hawaii. Okay. Okay.
[41:56.96]To Hawaii.
