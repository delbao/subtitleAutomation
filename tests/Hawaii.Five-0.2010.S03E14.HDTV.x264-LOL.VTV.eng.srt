00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:27,185
Keep me in the
loop, Commander.

179
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:28,903
I want constant updates.

180
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:31,072
And don't go through the office.

181
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:32,657
Call my cell directly.

182
00:08:35,444 --> 00:08:37,362
Understood, sir.

183
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,614
All right,
send him in.

184
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:44,769
Hold on,
let me get this straight.

185
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:46,638
Is this official business,
or is this a favor?

186
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,457
What difference does it make?
Well, it makes a very big difference,

187
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,210
you see, because official
business is, uh, official.

188
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:55,280
A favor is like a quid pro quo
kind of deal, right?

189
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,349
You... solve this
murder case for me,

190
00:08:57,351 --> 00:09:00,518
and I will give you, uh, oh,
five days' paid vacation.

191
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,254
Right? Or tickets to Monster
Truck Jam, or whatever.

192
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:04,973
Monster Truck Jam's
not in town.

193
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:07,842
Okay, so then it is, indeed,
official business.

194
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:09,144
Exactly.
Exac...? Wh-What...

195
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,845
None of this seems
strange to you?

196
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:13,898
Hold on. None of this seems, uh, in
the slightest bit off?

197
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,483
I mean, what are
these homeowners?

198
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:16,985
They, uh, big contributors

199
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:18,787
to the governor's
campaign, or what?

200
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:20,488
I have no idea.
And we can't talk to them?

201
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,407
Danny, is there a point
coming anytime soon? - Absolutely.

202
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:24,525
It seems to me like
we're taking a case

203
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:25,960
just to protect the
governor's friends.

204
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:27,662
With the governor's task force.
Then why

205
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:30,582
does it feel like we are performing
janitorial services, blindfolded,

206
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:32,751
I might add.
We've been given a directive, Danny.

207
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:34,169
Oh, right, I understand.

208
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:37,055
When McGarrett gets an order,
he takes the order.

209
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:38,539
You know what you're like?
You're like one

210
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,724
of those windup
toy soldiers.

211
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:41,476
Let me get you a drum
for Christmas to beat.

212
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:44,979
The last time we butted heads
with Denning, he sent Lori home.

213
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:48,683
I don't want to see what he's got
planned for an encore, do you?

214
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:52,987
Okay, here are some basics.

215
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:55,240
The homeowners' names
are Wendy and Patrick Duggan.

216
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:56,891
I checked into
their passport records.

217
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:58,576
They landed in Katmandu
last week.

218
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:01,062
According to their itinerary,
they're halfway into their hike.

219
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:03,782
Well, confirms what
Governor Denning told us.

220
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:05,834
How do you think
the cell service is on Everest?

221
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,036
I can't imagine it's too good.

222
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:08,703
We got any signs of forced entry?
No.

223
00:10:08,705 --> 00:10:10,622
Other than the Duggans,
the caretaker's the only one

224
00:10:10,624 --> 00:10:12,257
who claims to have
a set of keys.

225
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:13,875
HPD checked
his alibi.

226
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:15,043
It's airtight.

227
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:17,011
Max give us a COD?

228
00:10:17,013 --> 00:10:18,680
He hasn't posted the
vic yet, but based

229
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:20,932
on the bruising around her neck,
he's thinking she was strangled.

230
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:23,051
Maybe it was a crime
of passion, right?

231
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:24,719
Killer's having sex
with the vic,

232
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:25,937
then he gets a little rough,

233
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:27,522
things spin
out of control.

234
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:29,090
You got anything else?

235
00:10:29,092 --> 00:10:31,109
Yeah. Max found traces
of a powdery substance

236
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:32,394
around her left clavicle.

237
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:34,279
He sent it over
to Fong for processing.

238
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:37,949
I got an I.D.
on our vic.

239
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,434
Her name is
Serena Andrews.

240
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:40,452
HPD had her

241
00:10:40,454 --> 00:10:42,320
in their database.
What was she cited for?

242
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:44,239
Solicitation.

243
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,043
Houston, we've got a problem.

244
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:50,445
So we have a working girl killed

245
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:52,997
in a Kahala mansion belonging
to good friends of the governor.

246
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,716
Two questions:

247
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:55,800
did the governor know her,

248
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:57,502
and did he know
that she was a prostitute?

249
00:10:57,504 --> 00:10:58,920
And if he did,

250
00:10:58,922 --> 00:11:00,472
is he involved?

251
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:02,006
You like the way
this is going?

252
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,509
No, I don't.

253
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,740
<i>Serena didn't make it</i>
<i>home last night.</i>

254
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:22,697
Not exactly a big deal.

255
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:24,999
So she often stays out
all night?

256
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,316
Look, I'm
her roommate,

257
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,751
not her mother.

258
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,536
But she is a
friend of yours?

259
00:11:29,538 --> 00:11:30,571
Yeah.

260
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:32,322
How long you guys been here?

261
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,091
Six months.

262
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,261
Mollie, do you know that Serena
was cited for solicitation?

263
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:42,683
That was over a year ago.

264
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:44,351
What about you--
you ever been busted?

265
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:45,602
I'm a student.

266
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,770
Pretty pricey place.

267
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,389
Student loans cover this?

268
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,174
I don't like
what you're insinuating.

269
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:53,644
I'm not insinuating; I'm asking.

270
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,014
What's an all-night trick go for
these days-- two, three grand?

271
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,199
What I do with my body
is my business.

272
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:00,985
And when a body
shows up dead,

273
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,369
it's ours.

274
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:05,856
Oh, my God.

275
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,126
She was found dead at 3500
Hunukai Street in Kahala.

276
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,045
Do you know that address?

277
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:13,330
No.

278
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,798
Truth.

279
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,386
Look, Serena didn't usually work
with locals, okay?

280
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,588
Just high-end tourists
or conventioneers.

281
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,823
How did she hook up
with the johns?

282
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,092
There's this thing
called the Internet.

283
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,560
Maybe you've heard of it.

284
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:29,096
Where's your laptop?

285
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,387
So, if we can find
the last john Serena booked,

286
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,906
it could lead back
to our killer.

287
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,223
Her clientele

288
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:41,992
wouldn't use their real names,
though, would they?

289
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,410
Probably not.

290
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,079
Then again, the guys
we're dealing with

291
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:46,997
usually aren't thinking
with their heads.

292
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,699
Not the big one anyway.
Okay,

293
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,900
okay, copy that.

294
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,535
Let's just get Serena's laptop
over to Fong

295
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,253
and see if he can trace
the last IP address.

296
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,506
That could
be a while.

297
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,457
Why?

298
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,075
What's wrong?
Black SUV

299
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,011
two cars back--
you see it?

300
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,796
Oh, hello.

301
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:03,914
Yeah,

302
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,517
it's been tailing us
for the last two miles.

303
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:12,639
Yeah, okay, thanks, Max.

304
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:14,141
Hey.

305
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:15,258
TOD on Serena Andrews

306
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,260
was between 11:00
and 12:00 last night.

307
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:19,096
Max just confirmed that
she had sexual intercourse

308
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,364
just prior to
the murder.

309
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,264
So there's DNA.

310
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,533
Max just put a
rush order on it.

311
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,201
Lab should have some
answers any time soon.

312
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,369
I just got
off the phone

313
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,537
with the lab.

314
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,704
Did we get a hit?

315
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:28,939
I don't know.

316
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,041
You just said you got off
the phone with the lab.

317
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,293
I did, yeah, and they told me
they are on strict orders

318
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:34,461
not to rush the testing.

319
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:35,712
Orders from whom?

320
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,915
Governor Denning's office.

321
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,593
SUV's still on us.

322
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,354
That's three straight lefts.

323
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:02,389
Doubt they're looking
for a parking spot.

324
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,808
How do you want to play it?

325
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,277
Hold on.

326
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:12,800
Five-O!

327
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,201
Get out of the car now!

328
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:15,903
Hey, hey!

329
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,761
What the hell was
all that about?

330
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:28,048
I don't know,
but did you catch the plates?

331
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,384
"G" ride, yeah,
government issue.

332
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:37,891
Commander, Commander,

333
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:39,893
you cannot
go in there.

334
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:44,514
Am I running
this investigation or not?

335
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,618
Give us a
minute, please.

336
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:54,524
Don't ever do that again.

337
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,076
Why'd you ask me
to take over this case

338
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:57,077
if you're going to interfere?

339
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:59,246
There is a chain
of command here,

340
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:01,131
and you're not anywhere
near the top.

341
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,134
There is a state vehicle
surveilling my team.

342
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,369
Sir, the lab
can't process the DNA

343
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:07,370
on your orders.

344
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:08,889
Why are you blocking
every move I make?

345
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:11,808
My orders are not subject
to your scrutiny, Commander.

346
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,343
What the hell
are you hiding, Governor?

347
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,045
Just what the hell
are you implying?

348
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,897
The dead girl-- you knew
she was a prostitute.

349
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:18,548
The DNA we found
on the body--

350
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,900
is it yours?
No.

351
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,318
Is it yours, Governor?
No!

352
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,104
No, I did not know the
victim was a prostitute,

353
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,523
and no, it is not my DNA.

354
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:35,365
I don't know what
to believe here, sir.

355
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,252
When I run

356
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:43,173
that DNA... who is it going
to trace back to?

357
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:49,213
Chris Freed.

358
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:53,300
Congressman Christopher Freed?

359
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:56,803
Yes, our soon-
to-be senator.

360
00:15:56,805 --> 00:15:58,972
I don't understand.

361
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:02,592
Politics, Commander,
plain and simple.

362
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,811
Protect your flank at all costs.

363
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,563
Protect your ass
is what you mean.

364
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,035
Chris Freed and I go
a long way back.

365
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,271
I told him I'd help out
any way I can.

366
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,623
He needed a place
in town to stay,

367
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,408
I knew these party donors
who were away,

368
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,745
so I arranged it for him
to stay at their house--

369
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,549
the same house Serena Andrews'
body was found in.

370
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,833
Okay, why didn't
you tell me the truth

371
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:28,585
when you handed me the case?
Because

372
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,672
a scandal like this could
ruin a good man's life

373
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:32,973
and his chances
of being elected.

374
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:35,125
You didn't think
I was gonna find out?

375
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,312
I was hoping to contain your
findings as they came in,

376
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:39,813
determine if they
were credible.

377
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:42,065
If they were,
act accordingly.

378
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,734
You have to
understand,

379
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,187
Chris Freed is
a Medal of Honor recipient,

380
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:48,855
chairman of the Veteran Affairs
Committee.

381
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:51,441
And now he's a suspect
in a homicide investigation.

382
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,111
He is also my friend, Commander.

383
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,813
We served together.

384
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:01,668
Of all people,
you know what that means.

385
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,487
And, may I add,

386
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:07,374
he is also
a devoted single father,

387
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:09,826
so I wanted to
be damn sure

388
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:13,163
that the facts were straight
before we rip his life apart.

389
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,549
With all due respect...

390
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,336
...we just found
a dead prostitute in his bed.

391
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,688
So I have to ask you--
as his friend,

392
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,524
I have got to ask you...

393
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,009
do you think it's possible

394
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:30,280
Congressman Freed
could have killed this woman?

395
00:17:32,116 --> 00:17:34,318
I don't know.

396
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:46,988
<i>Okay, you know</i>
<i>what we call this</i>

397
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:48,321
in police work?
What?

398
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:49,956
A complete and total
waste of time.

399
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:50,941
Just listen to me.

400
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:51,992
Anybody knows where
the congressman is,

401
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:53,026
it's going to be
his press secretary.

402
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:54,310
He's not gonna
tell us anything.

403
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:56,730
These people lie for a
living-- you know that, right?

404
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:58,815
- This guy.
- All right, we got anything over there?

405
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:00,066
Excuse me,
Josh Lowry?

406
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:01,952
I'll have to call you back.

407
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:03,536
Uh, yeah, who are you?
Steve McGarrett.

408
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:05,405
This is
Detective Danny Williams.

409
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:06,873
We're with Five-O.
Hi. Oh.

410
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,275
Hey, we're looking
for Congressman Freed.

411
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:11,428
Yeah, Five-O,
thank you guys for coming down,

412
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,380
and you know the congressman
is a huge supporter

413
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:14,597
of the law enforcement
community.

414
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,766
Uh, can we get you guys
anything-- coffee or water?

415
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,051
No, we're good,
we just want

416
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:19,302
a minute with
the congressman.

417
00:18:19,304 --> 00:18:20,670
Yeah, you know what?

418
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:21,972
I-I wish you guys had called.

419
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:23,640
I could have saved you
the trouble.

420
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:25,525
Due to the accelerated
campaign schedule,

421
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:27,510
the congressman-- he's,
he's wall-to-wall today,

422
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:29,062
guys, he's very busy.

423
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:30,179
Very busy.

424
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:32,148
Yeah, slammed actually,

425
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,850
but I'm sure I can answer
any questions

426
00:18:33,852 --> 00:18:35,652
you guys might have
on the issues.

427
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:37,520
I-I have a question, actually.

428
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:38,705
Yeah, maybe you could tell us,

429
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:40,206
what's the
congressman's position

430
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,826
on dead hookers
found in his bed?

431
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:45,662
Strangled dead hookers.

432
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:49,966
Um, you know,
why don't we, uh,

433
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:51,200
why don't we speak
in private?

434
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:53,703
Sure.

435
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:55,805
No, there's no way.

436
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:57,490
There's got to be
some kind of mistake.

437
00:18:57,492 --> 00:19:00,393
The congressman would never get
involved with a prostitute.

438
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:02,545
His stand on the exploitation
of sex workers is very clear,

439
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:03,847
and as far as murder goes...

440
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,982
Let me guess,
he's completely against it.

441
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:08,318
Do you even know
the congressman?

442
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,969
Uh, about as much as
you can know somebody

443
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:12,105
in a 15-second sound bite.
Okay.

444
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:14,674
All I'm saying is,
spend ten minutes with the man.

445
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:15,942
You'd be absolutely convinced

446
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:18,061
at how outrageous
your accusations are.

447
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:20,246
Now, if this country had more
men like Congressman Freed...

448
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:22,032
There'd be a chicken
in every pot

449
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:24,284
and a dead ho
in every bed, right?

450
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:28,338
Look, uh, I've been with him

451
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,939
since his days
in the State House.

452
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:31,307
Okay?

453
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm not saying he's perfect
but pretty damn close,

454
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:35,745
and the mere
suggestion

455
00:19:35,747 --> 00:19:37,430
that he could be possibly
involved in something like this

456
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:40,416
is incredibly insulting to him,
to his family,

457
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:41,518
and to his legacy.

458
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,636
Okay, that is a,
a beautiful speech.

459
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:45,038
Okay, where is he?

460
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,589
Mr. Lowry,

461
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:49,258
if the congressman is as big
on law enforcement as you say,

462
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,361
then you understand,
we have to do our job.

463
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:52,595
Now, where is he?

464
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:55,031
We're not going
to ask you again.

465
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:59,018
Geez. Ah, boy.

466
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:02,722
We've been spinning all morning
to cover for him.

467
00:20:02,724 --> 00:20:04,991
Oh, you don't even know
where he is?

468
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:06,543
No, we don't.

469
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:08,411
You didn't think
to tell anybody?

470
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:10,413
Look, the political reality
is this:

471
00:20:10,415 --> 00:20:12,332
the special election
is a nail-biter.

472
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:13,917
We haven't had any time
to campaign.

473
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,385
Now, any little thing
could tip the scales.

474
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:19,472
Now, if news got out
that Freed was off the grid,

475
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:20,807
yeah, let's just say
that'd be bad.

476
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,126
No, no, I'll tell you
what'd be bad.

477
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:24,894
Bad would be
"Breaking News Story:

478
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:27,564
Congressman Freed,
Suspect in a Homicide."

479
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:29,265
Whoa...
Josh,

480
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:30,350
level with us.

481
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:32,135
All right,
where do you think he is?

482
00:20:32,137 --> 00:20:35,738
All I can think is that he and
Amy are somewhere, holed up,

483
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,940
prepping
for the debate.

484
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:38,641
Who's Amy?

485
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,527
Amy Davidson-- she's
Freed's chief of staff,

486
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:41,628
one of his closest confidants.

487
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,645
She runs
the campaign.

488
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:44,280
Well, where is she, Josh?

489
00:20:44,282 --> 00:20:46,749
I don't know, I don't,
I really don't.

490
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:48,201
I'm assuming with him.

491
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:52,288
So, if I'm Congressman Freed

492
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,790
in the middle
of a special election,

493
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:55,658
and something goes wrong...

494
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,293
Who's the first
person you call?

495
00:20:57,295 --> 00:20:59,112
My chief of staff Amy Davidson.

496
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:00,713
Right, so you can get together
and plan an alibi.

497
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:02,382
Any luck pinging the
congressman's phone?

498
00:21:02,384 --> 00:21:03,383
No, no signal.

499
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:04,384
Okay, well, try Amy's.

500
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:05,334
Chances are,

501
00:21:05,336 --> 00:21:06,803
we find one, we
find the other.

502
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:08,388
Hey, Steve, hold on,
Kono's got something.

503
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,507
You guys aren't gonna
believe this. The lab finally

504
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,342
processed the DNA
from the dead girl.

505
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:14,194
They got a hit.

506
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:15,311
Congressman Freed?

507
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:16,863
No.
Then who is it?

508
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:18,064
The match came back

509
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,483
from the National Database
to a Ryan Webb.

510
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:23,786
He's an associate professor
of English from Ohio.

511
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:25,822
He's in town for
a mystery writers convention.

512
00:21:25,824 --> 00:21:27,523
What's a teacher doing
in the system?

513
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:29,375
He's employed at a state school.
They require

514
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:32,361
DNA for background checks. Uh,
the IP address from the hotel

515
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:34,297
matched Serena's
last appointment.

516
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:35,748
According to the hotel,

517
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,750
he's scheduled
to check out this morning.

518
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,133
I got it.

519
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:57,270
Here, here, let me help you
with those bags.

520
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:58,838
What is this?
Who are you?

521
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,673
Five-O. We're
extending your stay.

522
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:04,694
Hope you had a nice visit.

523
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:07,981
<i>Please, this is all</i>
<i>a colossal mistake.</i>

524
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:10,583
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

525
00:22:10,585 --> 00:22:13,086
A mistake? Well, why don't you
help me understand?

526
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:14,504
Where's the congressman?

527
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:16,005
Congressman who?

528
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:19,209
Congressman Freed of the
great state of Hawaii.

529
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:21,044
Is that supposed
to mean something to me?

530
00:22:21,046 --> 00:22:23,079
I...

531
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:25,348
Party last night, remember?
Mansion in Kahala?

532
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,683
Last night?

533
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:29,085
Last night, I-I was
on an Elmore Leonard panel,

534
00:22:29,087 --> 00:22:31,638
and a bunch of us went
to the room to watch <i>Get Shorty.</i>

535
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,141
Yeah, you left the part out
about the dead prostitute.

536
00:22:37,645 --> 00:22:40,113
What? No.
No, no, no.

537
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:42,949
Obviously, fiction isn't
your strong suit, Professor,

538
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:44,484
'cause we have your DNA,

539
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:46,202
and it puts you in bed
with the hooker

540
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:47,487
at the congressman's house.

541
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:49,438
Look, look, come on.

542
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,374
I'm just an English teacher,
okay?

543
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:53,409
I don't know anything
about a congressman,

544
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:55,078
and I didn't kill anybody!

545
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,547
Nice wedding ring, by the way.

546
00:22:57,549 --> 00:22:59,082
How long you been married?

547
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:01,634
Wait a minute.

548
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:02,835
Maybe your wife

549
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:04,671
in Ohio knows
where you were last night.

550
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:07,924
Let's give her a call, see
what she got to say then.

551
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:09,192
Wait, wait, wait.

552
00:23:11,012 --> 00:23:13,396
Serena was alive
when I left her.

553
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:14,480
Well, how did you

554
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:16,482
wind up with the congressman?
I didn't.

555
00:23:16,484 --> 00:23:18,401
Okay, the girl and I--
we never left the bar.

556
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:20,019
Bar? What bar?

557
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:23,239
Have you ever been
to Lima, Ohio?

558
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:24,473
I mean, come on.

559
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:25,775
This is Hawaii.

560
00:23:25,777 --> 00:23:27,243
I-I just wanted to have fun.

561
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:29,329
So, I-I found this Web site,
and Serena--

562
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:31,814
she agreed to meet me
at the Liki Tiki Lounge.

563
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:33,666
Wait a minute. You're telling me
you had sex with her

564
00:23:33,668 --> 00:23:35,151
at the bar,
is that what you're saying?

565
00:23:35,153 --> 00:23:38,955
When-when she showed up, well...

566
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:42,091
...we-we did it in the bathroom.

567
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:44,994
I've always wanted to do that.
Back in Lima...

568
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:46,596
Then what?

569
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:48,765
Then-then she left.

570
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:50,850
What time was that?
About-about 10:00.

571
00:23:50,852 --> 00:23:52,018
What did you do after that?

572
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,886
I stayed and had a few more drinks.
Same bar?

573
00:23:53,888 --> 00:23:55,355
Yeah. No.
If you don't believe me,

574
00:23:55,357 --> 00:23:56,889
you can check
my credit card, okay?

575
00:23:56,891 --> 00:23:59,559
I ran a tab,
and I cashed out at last call.

576
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:02,562
Bartender confirms
seeing Serena Andrews

577
00:24:02,564 --> 00:24:04,447
leaving the Liki Tiki Lounge
around 10:00.

578
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:05,615
Well, what about Webb?

579
00:24:05,617 --> 00:24:07,483
Credit card checks out.
He closed the place.

580
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:10,353
Okay, so, 10:00 was the last
time anybody saw Serena alive.

581
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:12,872
Mm-hmm, and with TOD set
between 11:00 and 12:00...

582
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:14,824
There's no way Webb
could have killed her.

583
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,192
We're back
to square one.

584
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,294
Not exactly. Just got a call
from our friend Josh Lowry.

585
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:20,696
Looks like Freed's Chief
of Staff, Amy Davidson,

586
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:23,499
just walked into
campaign headquarters.

587
00:24:29,673 --> 00:24:32,925
Josh, where's Amy Davidson?

588
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:34,977
She's inside with Powers.

589
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:37,864
Brad Powers. That's, uh, Freed's
opponent. What's he doing here?

590
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:40,883
Well, he came by to discuss
the ground rules of the debate

591
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:42,385
with the congressman, I
was handling the situation.

592
00:24:42,387 --> 00:24:44,237
Then all of a sudden,
Amy shows up.

593
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:45,888
Picks up right where
she left off,

594
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,073
like nothing
even happened.

595
00:24:47,075 --> 00:24:48,691
Did she say where she was?
No, she didn't.

596
00:24:48,693 --> 00:24:50,226
She went behind closed doors
with Powers,

597
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:51,778
they've been in there
ever since.

598
00:24:53,664 --> 00:24:55,548
Josh, you disappoint me.

599
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,234
I don't know what kind of
campaign you're running here,

600
00:24:58,236 --> 00:25:00,169
but I don't buy Amy's
spin for a minute.

601
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:01,421
We're not spinning anything,
Mr. Powers.

602
00:25:01,423 --> 00:25:03,423
Really? Then what's
Five-O doing here?

603
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:04,841
That's between us
and the congressman, sir.

604
00:25:04,843 --> 00:25:06,626
Yeah, well, when you
see him, please ask him

605
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:09,295
why he blew me off last night
without so much as a phone call.

606
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:11,764
What time were you supposed to meet him?
11:00.

607
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:14,083
I've know Chris
Freed for 15 years.

608
00:25:14,085 --> 00:25:16,319
He's never pulled
a stunt like that.

609
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:18,271
I'm sure it's just
a misunderstanding, sir.

610
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:20,773
He said he wanted
to run a civil campaign,

611
00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:22,809
one with mutual respect
and all of that.

612
00:25:22,811 --> 00:25:25,194
This is a hell of
a way to show it.

613
00:25:25,196 --> 00:25:27,113
I don't know what you
people are hiding,

614
00:25:27,115 --> 00:25:30,533
but I'm gonna find out, and
when I do, so will the press.

615
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:32,435
Okay.

616
00:25:32,437 --> 00:25:34,737
We need to speak
to Amy now.

617
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:37,390
Amy?

618
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:39,575
I got Five-O here.
They need to talk to you.

619
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,878
Miss Davis,

620
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,746
where's Congressman Freed?

621
00:25:43,748 --> 00:25:45,415
I don't know,

622
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:48,568
but I think he might have done
something terrible.

623
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:58,770
Don't you think
I'd help you guys if I could?

624
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:00,739
I just don't know
where he is right now.

625
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:02,691
Okay, so, you--
where have you been?

626
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:04,225
I was out...
looking for him.

627
00:26:04,227 --> 00:26:05,443
Look, you don't get it.

628
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:06,861
This is complicated.

629
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:08,029
Then speak slowly, all right?

630
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:09,364
Because I need to understand

631
00:26:09,366 --> 00:26:11,616
why a man like Congressman Freed
would risk everything

632
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:13,084
to get serviced
by a prostitute.

633
00:26:13,086 --> 00:26:16,421
To tell you the truth, I brought
her to meet the congressman.

634
00:26:17,423 --> 00:26:18,757
That's a smart move.

635
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,875
Why'd you do that?

636
00:26:20,877 --> 00:26:24,495
Doesn't happen all the time,
but he's under a lot of stress,

637
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:26,264
and he's a single father,

638
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:28,350
so he's on his own.

639
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:30,468
I mean, besides his daughter,
there's...

640
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,520
there's really no one else
in his life.

641
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:34,005
So sometimes he just needs

642
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:35,557
a little companionship
for the evening.

643
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,226
So you're chief of staff
and part-time madam for him?

644
00:26:38,228 --> 00:26:39,861
Come on, the guy's human.

645
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:42,113
All right, Amy,
I have to ask you.

646
00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:43,514
To the best of your knowledge,

647
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:46,284
has the congressman ever hurt
any of the women he's been with?

648
00:26:46,286 --> 00:26:49,487
Rough stuff doesn't seem
to be his thing,

649
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:52,691
but you know, who knows what
goes on behind closed doors?

650
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:54,576
Okay, well, something happened
last night.

651
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:56,411
Where did you find
Serena Andrews?

652
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:58,580
Picked her up at a place called
the Liki Tiki Lounge,

653
00:26:58,582 --> 00:27:00,531
and I dropped her off
at the mansion in Kahala.

654
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:01,716
No, you delivered her

655
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:03,251
to the congressman,
like a pizza.

656
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:04,753
Yes.

657
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:06,121
What about the
congressman's

658
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:08,840
11:00 with Powers?
Why did he blow that off?

659
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:10,041
I don't know.

660
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:11,676
That's why I went
back to the mansion.

661
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:13,878
But when I got there,
he was gone,

662
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,814
and I found the girl in the bed.

663
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:17,182
And being the pragmatic
political operative

664
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:18,516
that you are, you decided to go

665
00:27:18,518 --> 00:27:19,901
to the governor
instead of the police?

666
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:21,686
Because I knew
they were friends,

667
00:27:21,688 --> 00:27:23,822
and I needed time to think.

668
00:27:23,824 --> 00:27:24,606
To plan a cover-up.

669
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:26,224
No!

670
00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:29,661
No. Look, something like this
has national repercussions.

671
00:27:29,663 --> 00:27:32,230
Okay, you need
to have a viable strategy.

672
00:27:32,232 --> 00:27:34,332
What time did you pick up
Serena Andrews?

673
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:36,201
9:00, 9:15?

674
00:27:36,203 --> 00:27:38,336
She was right on time.

675
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:41,256
Am I under arrest?

676
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:43,174
Amy might be a
good chief of staff,

677
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:44,509
but she's a
terrible liar.

678
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:46,177
All right, the professor
was shot and now Serena

679
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:47,512
in a bathroom
stall at 9:15.

680
00:27:47,514 --> 00:27:49,080
She didn't leave
the bar till 10:00.

681
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:50,382
You're right.

682
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:51,700
If I'm right, then why
isn't she under arrest?

683
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:53,301
'Cause we still have
to find the congressman,

684
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:55,370
and if he's on the run, chances
are he's gonna reach out to her.

685
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:56,538
So let's sit
on her phone,

686
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,106
post a surveillance
team at her door.

687
00:27:58,108 --> 00:27:59,774
Exactly, and let Freed
come to us.

688
00:27:59,776 --> 00:28:01,539
The thing I want to know is,
why is Amy lying?

689
00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:03,028
What do you got?

690
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:05,947
That powdery substance
Max found on the body?

691
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:07,315
IR Spectroscopy identified it

692
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:09,451
as cornstarch.

693
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:11,769
Cornstarch?
Specifically, the type

694
00:28:11,771 --> 00:28:13,238
used in surgical gloves.

695
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,206
It makes them easier
to pull on and off.

696
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,441
That explains...
Why we didn't find any prints

697
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:18,760
belonging to our killer.
That does not sound

698
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:20,111
like a crime of passion.

699
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:21,796
That definitely sounds like
the killing was premeditated.

700
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:23,281
So, why would
the congressman plan

701
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:24,999
on killing a prostitute
he just met?

702
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:26,968
Unless he knew her previously.

703
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,636
Or there's something
we're not seeing here.

704
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:30,755
Or unless he didn't do it.

705
00:28:30,757 --> 00:28:33,391
So, I traced Amy Davidson's
timeline. Guess what?

706
00:28:33,393 --> 00:28:35,009
Doesn't add up.

707
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:36,478
Ah, she was lying.

708
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,645
Very shocking.
Mm-hmm.

709
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:39,314
She said she picked up
Serena Andrews

710
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,632
from the Liki Tiki Lounge
at 9:15.

711
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:42,817
But when I ran her credit cards,

712
00:28:42,819 --> 00:28:44,185
it turned out,
she was having drinks

713
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:45,937
at another place
called the Ocean Lounge.

714
00:28:45,939 --> 00:28:47,939
By herself?
She bought two rounds.

715
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:49,107
Two drinks each time.

716
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:50,909
Who she was with?
Josh Lowry,

717
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:53,178
congressman's press secretary.
He confirmed it.

718
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,612
Said they were having
a strategy session.

719
00:28:54,614 --> 00:28:55,914
He also confirmed

720
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:57,532
that they didn't leave
the place together.

721
00:28:57,534 --> 00:28:59,451
According to a
bartender I spoke to,

722
00:28:59,453 --> 00:29:01,152
she left with an
unknown male companion.

723
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:02,987
We need a positive ID
on that companion.

724
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:03,955
It's gonna be tough.

725
00:29:03,957 --> 00:29:05,173
No security footage
from the bar.

726
00:29:05,175 --> 00:29:06,711
I found an ATM camera
across the street.

727
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:07,343
Nice.

728
00:29:08,545 --> 00:29:09,994
Only thing is,

729
00:29:09,996 --> 00:29:11,596
I don't think there's
a clear shot of the exit.

730
00:29:11,598 --> 00:29:13,131
Not so nice.

731
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:15,183
Okay, easy. What it
did give us was a shot

732
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:16,184
of a police cruiser
pulling someone

733
00:29:16,186 --> 00:29:17,852
over near the
club entrance.

734
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:19,888
Huh. We got a dashboard cam?
Yeah, we have a dashboard cam,

735
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,639
and I have

736
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:24,609
footage coming through
right now.

737
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:26,728
That's Amy. Freeze,

738
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,846
Kono. Freeze that.
Can you push in?

739
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:31,866
Looks like she's with someone.

740
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:35,487
Wow.

741
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:38,990
It's Wo Fat. He's
still on the island.

742
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:40,575
What the hell is he doing
with Amy?

743
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:43,962
He's using Amy Davidson
to set up Congressman Freed.

744
00:29:43,964 --> 00:29:45,830
Set up for what?

745
00:29:45,832 --> 00:29:47,465
Think about it.
Who stands

746
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:50,635
to gain if Congressman Freed
takes a hard fall?

747
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:52,170
His opponent, Brad Powers.

748
00:29:52,172 --> 00:29:53,371
Wo Fat

749
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:55,974
sees this special election
as an opening.

750
00:29:55,976 --> 00:29:57,725
He's on the run,
he's got no resources.

751
00:29:57,727 --> 00:29:59,310
What better way
to rebuilt your empire

752
00:29:59,312 --> 00:30:00,812
than to buy a politician?

753
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:02,063
Right, by discrediting Freed,

754
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:03,398
Powers definitely gets
the Senate seat.

755
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,183
And Wo Fat gets a friend
in Washington.

756
00:30:05,185 --> 00:30:06,351
Quid pro quo.

757
00:30:06,353 --> 00:30:10,772
Not on our watch.

758
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:25,620
You need to
start writing.

759
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:29,340
Go to hell.

760
00:30:29,342 --> 00:30:31,376
I expected a more
dignified response

761
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:32,760
from a congressman.

762
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:35,847
Cut me loose, and I'll show you
how dignified I can can be

763
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:37,748
when I pound the crap
out of you.

764
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:42,103
You're not
thinking this through.

765
00:30:44,757 --> 00:30:48,192
Why should I sign the equivalent
of a suicide note?

766
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:50,928
That'd be the end of my career,
my life.

767
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,315
Even if I sign it,
you're going to kill me anyway.

768
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:56,317
A homegrown treasure like you?

769
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:58,620
A bona fide war hero?

770
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:00,989
No.

771
00:31:00,991 --> 00:31:04,242
I have too much respect
for your accomplishments.

772
00:31:04,244 --> 00:31:05,543
However...

773
00:31:05,545 --> 00:31:08,463
my affections

774
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:10,665
don't extend to your daughter.

775
00:31:18,457 --> 00:31:19,957
Where is he?

776
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,509
Excuse me?

777
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:23,961
Wo Fat. Where is he? We know
you left the bar with him.

778
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:25,346
Okay, you need to leave.

779
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:26,731
I don't think you understand
who you're dealing with.

780
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:27,982
No, I said, you need to leave.

781
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:29,567
Everything you've said

782
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:30,685
up to this point is a lie.

783
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:31,953
All right, the congressman
with prostitutes,

784
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:34,122
you bringing 'em
to him, all of it.

00:31:34,124 --> 00:31:35,773
Okay, I can't talk to you guys
about this right now.

Get this through
your head, okay?

787
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,827
If Freed's not dead already,
Wo Fat will kill him.

788
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:41,029
You understand
what I'm saying?

789
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:43,164
You can stop this.

790
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,199
You can stop all of this, but
you have to start talking to us.

791
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:46,284
Where is Congressman Freed?

792
00:31:46,286 --> 00:31:48,453
Where is he, Amy?

793
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:50,421
Huh?

794
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:51,873
What are you doing?

795
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:55,376
Don't shush me.
What are you doing?

00:32:07,556 --> 00:32:10,191
I'm sorry.

797
00:32:10,193 --> 00:32:13,227
I did it because he said
he was gonna kill me.

Listen to me,

799
00:32:14,614 --> 00:32:16,814
where is he keeping
the congressman hostage?

800
00:32:16,816 --> 00:32:18,182
I don't know!

801
00:32:18,184 --> 00:32:19,701
- Amy...
- I really don't know.

00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:21,986

Looks like there's been
a change in plans.

811
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:17,903
Geez, brah.
You scared me.

00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,895
You went above and
beyond, Commander.

876
00:39:43,897 --> 00:39:45,397
And...

877
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:47,682
I'm sorry.

878
00:39:48,918 --> 00:39:50,535
Sir?

879
00:39:50,537 --> 00:39:53,288
I should've been straight
with you from the start.

880
00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:57,191
Trust-   it, um...

881
00:39:57,193 --> 00:40:00,879
Well, it's a mighty big word.

882
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:05,834
Yeah, it is.

883
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,669
And if I may...

884
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,804
Of course. I'm
sitting in shorts,

885
00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:11,372
drinking beer with you.

886
00:40:11,374 --> 00:40:14,259
All right, fire away
and don't hold back.

887
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:18,046
I got a lot of respect
for you, sir.

888
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,381
Got a lot of respect
for the office.

889
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:22,150
But if this thing
between us

890
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:24,185
is gonna work out then...

891
00:40:24,187 --> 00:40:26,104
honesty is the best policy.

892
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:29,390
Your predecessor, she didn't
believe in that and, uh...

893
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:31,776
well, it got her killed.

894
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,498
Well...

895
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,084
that was her.
This is me.

896
00:40:39,086 --> 00:40:41,453
To Five-O.

897
00:40:42,288 --> 00:40:44,456
All right.

898
00:40:49,962 --> 00:40:52,130
Hey.
Hey.

899
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:53,682
Uh...

900
00:40:54,517 --> 00:40:56,351
You all good?

901
00:40:57,887 --> 00:40:59,220
Uh...

902
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:00,689
she's not moving.

903
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,941
Grace?
The judge

904
00:41:02,943 --> 00:41:06,027
ruled in my favor--
shared custody.

905
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:07,195
She cannot leave
the island.

906
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:10,315
She cannot leave
the island. Huh?

907
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:12,534
Huh?

908
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:13,985
Congratulations.

909
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:15,286
Thank you, buddy.

910
00:41:15,288 --> 00:41:16,955
Congratulations.

911
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:17,956
Thank you.

912
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,041
Hey.
Thank you.

913
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:21,960
Uh, the judge said

914
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:24,278
that your courtroom behavior
was completely unacceptable

915
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,781
Oh, come on. and despicable,
but she also said that you were

916
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:29,334
a fantastic character witness,
so thank you very much.

917
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:32,053
You're welcome.
I'll remind you of that later.

918
00:41:32,055 --> 00:41:33,304
I'm sure you will.

919
00:41:33,306 --> 00:41:34,923
Well done, gentlemen.

920
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,793
I can't believe I'm actually
happy to be staying here.

921
00:41:38,795 --> 00:41:40,061
Neither can I.

922
00:41:41,314 --> 00:41:43,064
To Hawaii.

923
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:44,349
To Hawaii.

924
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:46,300
To, uh...

925
00:41:50,768 --> 00:41:53,903
To Hawaii. Okay. Okay.

926
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:58,278
<i>To Hawaii.</i>
