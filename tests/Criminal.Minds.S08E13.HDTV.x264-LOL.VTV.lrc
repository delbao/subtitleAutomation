[00:00.00]<R4>Hotch: Previously on "Criminal Minds"...|Do you think he knows about us? As far as I can tell he doesn't.Well, guess I'll talk to you next Sunday.
[00:08.63]<R2>Bye. Love you.I need to tell you something. Maeve is missing. I think her stalker has her.
[00:15.90]<R3>Please help me.
Help me find her.
See, it's not about the message.
[00:21.21]It's about the medium. What he used to draw on her face.
Reid; The stalker's a woman. It's black eyeliner.
Excuse me, Doctor.
Reid: I think I know who the unsub is.
[00:28.25]Where did you get Maeve's clothes?
From her closet.
Right after I bashed her head in.
Get on the ledge.
If you're gonna kill me, you kill me,
[00:35.05]but I am not jumping.
Spencer has a different idea.
Diane: Take your gun and vest off and come in alone.
[00:41.89]Let me take her place.
You would kill yourself for her?
Yes.
[00:47.10][Gunshot] Wait!
[01:01.85]Danielle, it's Kelly--again.
Where are you? When I said let's go out dancing tonight,
[01:08.12]I didn't expect it to involve you leaving me alone
while you scam on some frat guy.
Call me. You've got 10 minutes, then I'm out of here.
[01:45.22]Hey!
Hello?
[01:57.03][Indistinct]
How was work?
It sucked. Tips were horrible.
[02:15.68][Screaming]
[02:32.73][Footsteps]
[02:41.22]Hey.
Hey.
Thought I'd check on Spence on my way into work.
[02:49.80]Yeah. Me, too.
Are these all from you?
[02:56.01]Maybe.
What's in that one?
Mixed nuts and seeds.
[03:02.51]I'm trying to think of something that will help him feel better.
So I went Reid-like and I did a bunch of research
[03:08.02]and it turns out that nuts and seeds
have naturally occurring magnesium,
and magnesium influences the production of serotonin,
[03:15.19]which is a happy happy joy joy chemical in the brain. I don't know.
[Doorbell rings]
[03:21.73]Spence, listen, if you're in there,
we just want to know that you're all right.
[03:28.44]Knock twice if you're conscious.
[Knock knock]
[03:37.85]Is he ever gonna be okay?
Eventually.
And he knows we're all here for him,
[03:45.62]no matter what.
Yeah. What she said.
Come on.
[03:51.86]Okay.
[04:52.48]Hello. This is Spencer Reid. Please leave a message.
[Beep]
Hey, Reid, it's me. Again.
[04:58.56]Hey, we're gathering.
All right, I'm coming.
Now, listen, kid, uh, give me a call
[05:04.50]when you can.
Was that him?
Voicemail.
[05:11.80]It's been two weeks.
You okay?
Yeah.
[05:19.41]Well, no.
Sometimes I wonder if I hadn't pushed him
so hard to meet Maeve...
[05:25.48]Blake, you can't blame yourself for encouraging him.
I know. I know.
It was bound to happen no matter what.
[05:31.45]I miss Reid.
Did he tell you how long?
No. I told him to take as much time as he needed.
[05:38.26]At least I got a chance to say good-bye to Carolyn.
I can't imagine--
[05:44.43]yeah.
Ladies and gents, the Golden State awaits.
Meet who was formerly Gary Porter.
[05:51.77]He was found dead outside a San Francisco night club last night.
And Pamela Hurd-- she was found near a cable car stop
in San Francisco's Mission District.
[05:58.84]They were both found wrapped in clear plastic.
It says here they were dead only a few hours before they were found.
[06:04.48]That's not long enough for the elements to have made them that pale.
'Cause that's where we enter the town of weirdville
on the corner of eew and icky-icky.
[06:11.09]Both victims were almost completely drained of their blood.
Less than a pint left.
He's exsanguinating them.
[06:17.10]While they were still alive.
It might be utilitarian. He needs them alive
so they can pump out the blood themselves.
Draining a body like that
[06:24.24]is extremely hard to do.
Once the heart stops pumping,
it's difficult to continue to extract the blood.
So the question is, how is he doing it?
[06:31.51]Oh, I wish you wouldn't have asked that
'cause now I gotta show this picture.
There are large bore holes in the femoral artery of each victim.
[06:39.02]Our unsub could have medical knowledge.
It's possible. We'll know more when we get there.
Wheels up in 30.

[07:31.92]♪
[08:03.83]JJ: "My blood alone remains. Take it.
But do not make me suffer long."
[08:09.27]Marie Antoinette.
Why these two victims?
He's crossed socioeconomic, race, and gender lines.
[08:16.40]One white males in his 40s,
a wealthy hedge fund manager.
And an African American female, just started college
[08:22.38]at San Francisco State, worked several jobs just to get by.
Yeah, but why drain the blood?
Is he doing it to torture the victims?
[08:28.78]Or is it about the blood?
Might be a form of psychological torture.
While not necessarily painful,
[08:34.99]exsanguination does take time.
It could be a fetish for the blood and the bloodletting.
[08:40.03]What about...
drinking it?
Fritz Haarmann, the vampire of Hanover,
[08:47.20]killed many of his victims by biting through their throats.
This unsub used some sort of tubing device
to drain the blood from the femoral arteries.
[08:55.24]There isn't any saliva on the wound.
Just because there's no bite marks
doesn't mean we should rule out vampirism.
[09:02.68][Beep]
Bad news, crime-fighters. Police just found
another body wrapped in plastic
on a park bench, drained of blood.
[09:09.39]I'm gonna assume there's not two creeps in the area
doing the same thing?
Garcia, will you tell San Francisco P.D.
We'll meet them at the crime scene?
Consider them told.
[09:15.82]Dave, you and Blake meet the detectives at the crime scene.
Morgan, go see the medical examiner,
and JJ and I will set up at the police station.
[09:21.93]We'll talk to the families, see if we can find a connection.
[09:31.02]Detective.
SSA Rossi. This is SSA Blake.
Detective Lenny Miles. It's great to have you guys here.
[09:37.49]So the victim's name is Lynn Stevens.
She's drained, just like the last two,
but there's something new.
[09:44.17]New?
He's removed her eyelids.
I don't even want to take a guess as to why someone would do that.
[09:51.77]There's excessive blood around the eyes.
He did this antemortem.
His sadism is evolving.
[09:58.95]And his torture is definitely
more than psychological at this point.
I just don't understand why someone would do this.
[10:06.75]It's all still so hard to believe.
I just need to ask you a few questions about your husband.
[10:15.50]Pammy was a great girl. You know?
Really friendly.
She loved everyone, and everyone loved her.
[10:22.77]And you two had worked together
the night that she was abducted?
He called me.
[10:28.77]He said he was on his way home from work.
He just needed to stop off and close up a deal.
[10:36.78]He didn't have anything in his schedule for that night.
Do you have any idea what that deal was?
[10:42.85]After work, she said she always liked to go on long walks.
She was always going on about the architecture,
[10:50.13]how it's nothing like Oregon.
She had just moved to San Francisco?
Are there any other friends of hers that you know
[10:56.90]who we should talk to?
She was paying her way through school.
When she wasn't there, she was always at another job.
[11:05.21]Just trying to stay afloat.
You know?
If you think of anything else,
please, don't hesitate to call.
[11:17.22]If these victims are connected, I can't see it.
It's got to be about the blood.
Yeah, but even that's different.
[11:23.43]Gary was A-positive, Pam was O-neg.
We just got the lab report back on the latest victim, Lynn Stevens.
She was AB-negative.
[11:29.90]Maybe these are just victims of opportunity.
Well, it's possible the unsub abducted Pamela on
one of her routine walks.
[11:36.00]He could have lured Gary with the promise of a lucrative money deal.
[11:52.32]Hi. I'm Aimee.
Nice place.
[11:58.16]Okay, so it's going to be 75 for the hour.
Anything more than that we can discuss.
[12:04.23]All right?
Someplace where I can get changed?
There.
I don't know which positions you want me in,
[12:11.90]but I'm very flexible.
[12:21.15]What's up, baby girl?
I'm worried about Reid.
I am, too.
What do you think he's doing?
[12:27.29]I think he's taking the time that Hotch gave him.
I get it. He's sad. He should be sad.
But I'm so worried.
[12:33.09]And when someone I love is hurting,
it's like I hurt, too, which I know is super codependent,
but it's just how I roll, and I feel like I should be doing something,
[12:41.03]and I don't know what it is, but--
All right, slow down, all right? Just slow down.
Could you call him?
I have. He's just not ready to talk to anybody right now.
[12:48.54]I need to hear his voice. It's impairing my ability to work.
Let me try something, all right?
[12:54.94]Thanks.
Hello. This is Spencer Reid. Please leave a message.
[13:00.52][Beep]
Hey, Reid, it's Derek. Listen, I got a work question for you.
The unsub's exsanguinating victims and removing their eyelids antemortem.
[13:07.12]Does that mean anything to you? Hit me back.
[Door opens]
Here's the information you called about.
[13:15.53]Thank you.
[Cell phone rings]
Excuse me for a second.
[13:22.37]What's up, Reid?
Have the cornea or pupils been harmed in any way?
No, no. Blake said it looked like a very sharp instrument was used.
[13:30.91]If he's taking care not to damage the eyes,
then line of sight is probably what's important to him.
[13:36.38]So this guy wants them to see what he's doing.
Hey, Reid. How are you?
[13:45.73]I gotta go.
[13:54.50]Sorry about that.
Not a problem.
Cause of death would definitely be exsanguination.
[14:00.31]But the tox screen showed high levels of--
say this 5 times fast-- ethylene diamine tetra acetic.
EDTA. It's an anti-coagulant.
[14:07.48]Used mostly to treat heart conditions.
So the unsub probably used it to thin the blood.
[14:13.05]The ketamine we found may have helped as well.
In humans, it tends to elevate blood pressure.
Which is how he's sedating them.
If he knew that he was giving these drugs to these victims
[14:21.59]and he ingested the blood?
He'd be dosing himself as well.
Well, that rules out vampirism.
Is there any chance this guy works in the medical field?
[14:29.13]I doubt it. There are a few hesitation marks near the wound,
and the hole in the artery shows a lot of bruising around it.
I'd say it's amateur at best.
[14:36.07]All right, so we got an unsub
who's picking his victims at random,
sedates them, then bleeds them dry.
[14:42.01]If he's not drinking the blood, what the hell is he doing with it?
[15:05.10]Wait...
Wait...
[Breathing hard]
Shh, shh, shh. Be still.
[15:12.34]What's--what-- what are you doing?
Wait--wait--aah!
[15:31.35]Well, we got a hit off the prints.
The victim's name is Aimee Fortner.
[15:37.73]It's only been a day since his last kill.
Well, this guy doesn't have a cool-down period.
[15:43.23]Rigor hasn't set in yet.
I'd say she was put here maybe an hour ago,
just after sunrise.
[15:49.07]He's getting brazen.
It's his first daytime disposal.
Well, this part of the park's not very well traveled.
The city's been trying to renovate every couple of years,
[15:56.91]but you know--politics.
So the unsub is familiar enough with the area
to know nobody would disturb him.
[16:03.12]Office of omnipotence. How may I dazzle you?
Garcia, I need information on the latest victim, Aimee Fortner.
Information is my favorite way to dazzle, sir.
[16:11.69]So sparkly.
Here we go Aimee Crystal Fortner.
Originally from Santa Clara.
She was super pretty.
[16:17.63]When she wasn't bartending, she supplemented her income
by modeling.
A model?
[16:23.00]Yes. And she's got a website
full of very artistic pictures of herself.
Girl was not afraid to flaunt what God gave her at all.
[16:31.88]Uh-huh. Thanks, Garcia.
[16:37.45]What are you thinking?
[16:43.52]Reid told Morgan line of sight
was important to the unsub.
[16:53.90]We should take a look at the other crime scenes.
I might know what he's doing with the blood.
[17:05.64]We believe that this unsub is a white male in his 20s or 30s,
and he thinks of himself as a painter or an artist.
[17:12.82]The placement of the victims tells us a lot about who he is.
Pamela Hurd was found near a painting done by
[17:19.26]little known San Francisco artist Henry Floyd.
Gary Porter was posed near a piece of graffiti art
by a street artist named Cypher, who is currently wanted by the police.
[17:27.46]Hotch: And the third victim, Lynn Stevens, was found near a mural
painted by inner city youths.
Finally, Aimee Fortner was placed near the statue of Saint Luke,
[17:35.31]patron Saint of the artist.
JJ: This is a compulsion. It's not accidental.
He is obsessed with art.
Rossi: All of the works of art are neglected,
[17:42.62]ignored, cast aside.
It's how he feels about himself.
Hotch: We believe it's also the reason that he's evolved
to removing the victims eyelids.
[17:49.63]He's forcing them to see what he sees.
There's no sexual component with these murders,
but that's because the blood and the use of the blood
[17:57.44]is his sexual release.
So, wait.
What--what is he doing with the blood?
Because he's so obsessed with art,
[18:04.15]we believe he's painting with it.
Rossi: He has a quick kill pace.
More blood means more paint.
The more paintings he does,
[18:11.55]the greater the chance someone will recognize his work.
We think that because of his need for acceptance,
he may be trying to sell the paintings.
[18:18.23]So focus your canvassing on places
that might sell this kind of fringe art.
[18:38.95][Cell phone rings]
What's up, kid?
[18:44.45]If it is about the art,
then it's clear the disposal sites are scattered
around the Mission District area.
Wait a minute. How did you know--
[18:51.79]I had Anderson bring over some of the files.
All right. All right, hold on a second. Let me patch in Garcia.
[18:57.13][Dialing]
What have you heard? Is he okay?
Slow down. Slow down.
[19:04.54]Reid.
Garcia, you should pull a list
of all the art galleries in San Francisco.
Reid, I was just--
[19:12.31]how are you?
Better.
Thanks for asking.
[19:18.12]And thanks for the baskets.
You know, nuts have magnesium, which helps produce--
Serotonin. Yeah. I know.
[19:27.49]Okay, galleries. I got a lot.
Focus on the Mission District.
[19:35.00]I guess that's better than nothing.
It is. I will take it.
Okay, there's still a few galleries, but it's more manageable.
[19:43.04]I am sending the addresses to your mobile.
I got it. Thanks, Garcia.
Yeah.
[19:59.76]It's an original Hellman.
He painted it while literally on his deathbed.
[20:05.23]10,000.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
[20:11.10]Yeah? Madison.
He's back.
The museum is ready to make me an offer.
[20:18.27]Perfect.
If you want, I can tell him to leave.
No, it's okay.
[20:25.85]Mrs. Riley.
I think you'll be much more pleased with my piece this time.
[20:34.69]Yeah, um, like I told you the last time,
I'm not interested.
[20:42.13]Why not?
Well, because this type of art
is just not what we're looking for.
[20:49.84]Well, what is it you are looking for?
Uh...
[20:55.57]Look, I can see that you're getting better.
All I can tell you is it's a little simplistic.
[21:03.32]Look, every good artist leaves a piece of himself on the canvas.
You have to find that one thing
[21:10.16]that's going to set you apart from the rest of the crowd.
I used blood.
An unusual medium is not what I'm talking about.
[21:23.13]The world today doesn't make sense.
Why should I paint pictures that do?
Picasso.
[21:30.51]I'm impressed.
If I find my signature, you'll consider me for the gallery?
[21:39.22]Anything's possible.
Yeah.
[21:45.82]Thank you.
[22:00.14]Can I help you?
We're from the FBI.
You the owner?
Yeah. Name's Tre.
Do you have any art on display where blood is used as a medium?
[22:09.08]No.
No, but there was a guy in here a couple days ago
who tried to sell me a piece like that.
[22:15.55]It wasn't exactly my taste,
but a customer of mine happened to be in here,
saw it, fell in love with it, bought it on sight.
[22:24.39]You think that could that be your guy?
You wouldn't happen to have any security cameras in here, would you?
No.
[22:30.93]We need the customer's name if you've got it.
Yeah.
[22:51.68]I never quite understood these things.
It all looks like the guy had a seizure while painting it.
[22:57.36]It's Emile Hartford.
It's early 20th century.
[23:03.70]His daughter died when she was 8.
He said every time he painted, he'd be able to see her.
[23:09.27]Don't know how you see anything in there.
I guess that's why they say art is in the eye of the beholder.
[23:18.94]Yeah.
You know what else is in the eye of the beholder?
'57 Chevy I told you about last week?
[23:26.12]This morning, bam, it won't start.
Now it's in the eye of my mechanic.
[23:36.13]Come on, man, are you gonna make me ask
or are you gonna be a friend and offer me a ride home?
[23:44.40]We're friends.
Worked together for two years now. I'd hope so.
[23:55.51]You need a ride, Paul?
Thought you'd never ask.
[24:07.76]The unsub sold his painting to this place?
It reminds me of the eighties.
[24:15.43]What?
Do I even want to know?
Probably.
[24:28.61]Welcome. My name is Andre.
Before we start, I'll need you to fill out a small waiver.
No, no, no. We're not a couple.
[24:34.85]That's okay. We cater to all kinds of relationships.
Well, uh, our relationship
is with the FBI.
[24:41.95]Oh.
I run a clean establishment here.
[24:47.33]Clean, legal, adult fun.
Calm down. We're just looking for a painting you bought recently.
[24:53.00]You're gonna have to be a bit more specific.
I'm a connoisseur of the dark and depraved arts.
I purchase a lot of paintings.
[24:59.64]Well, you bought this one a couple of days ago.
It's made with blood.
Human blood.
Like I said, I buy a lot of paintings.
[25:05.98]I don't remember them all.
Oh, really? Because last I checked,
withholding evidence would make you an accomplice.
[25:13.55]We just want to see the painting.
Just want to see if it's from the guy we're looking for.
[25:20.89]Remembering now?
Possibly.
For that piece, you'll have to follow me to the spanking room.
[25:30.57]I may have bought it, but I didn't realize
it was evidence of any sort.
[25:36.44]Is that that you're looking for?
The tortured look in her eyes is what first drew me to it.
[25:45.45]The guy was asking 1,500 for it. I got him to take 250, cash.
That's our first victim, Pamela Hurd.
[25:52.69]It's definitely from our guy.
Yeah, we're gonna need to take this.
[26:06.70][Muttering]
What are you doing?
[26:14.84]What...
What...
What's going on?
[26:23.38]It...
Wawa.
What--
[26:30.89]no, please don't.
Why?
[26:38.46]It's the only way.
Sorry.
[26:44.00]You're insane.
I guess every artist is a little crazy.
No, come on man, we're friends.
[26:50.98]Exactly.
It's what I've been missing. Something personal.
[27:00.68]I need you to hold still.
Hold still.
[27:07.99]Hold still..
Hold still!
Help!
[27:13.46][Grunting]
No! Aah!
No!
[27:25.37]No...No!
[27:41.77]Well, we now have a piece of his art,
but we still don't have anything to identify the unsub.
[27:47.57]The lab's got a sample, but it's probably Pamela Hurd's blood.
Master Andre said he was an average white guy
in his late 20s to early 30s.
[27:54.34]Same thing the gallery owner said. He signed it.
Yeah, it looks like a "B" something or something "B".
[28:01.68]I'm going to have Garcia compile a list of artists
with the letter "B" somewhere in their name.
It's not much, but it's something.
[30:05.64]We got the report back from the lab.
They couldn't extract any DNA from the painting.
They said something about there only being red blood cells.
[30:12.78]Hmm. He removed the white blood cells.
Plasma.
Why would he take the plasma?
[30:19.31]It would make it thicker. Easier to use as a paint.
What type of equipment would it take to do that?
You can easily buy a centrifuge online these days
[30:26.15]for a couple hundred bucks.
What other reasons would he have for separating
the plasma from the blood?
It's a habit.
[30:34.20]- Reid. - Spence.
[30:40.83]I didn't expect you back this soon. You sure you're ready?
No, but I think I figured something out.
[30:59.32]Where's Mrs. Riley?
You need to leave.
It's okay, Alan, I'll handle it.
I did what you said.
[31:07.49]This is my friend, Paul.
[31:16.44]I even used some of my own blood.
That's not what I meant.
[31:24.98]But you said if I made it more personal,
you'd use me in your gallery.
[31:31.38]Look, I've been trying to be nice and give you some encouragement,
but I can see now that that's really not gonna help you.
So I think I just have to be blunt.
[31:39.02]It's not good.
But...
[31:45.30]This is--
this is abstract.
I understand the concept,
but splashing something onto a canvas,
[31:52.74]that doesn't make it art.
Some people have it, some people don't.
[32:02.71]You don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe not, but that still doesn't mean that I'm gonna buy this.
But you said--
[32:08.85]Look, I don't know how to explain this to you any better.
There is a difference between a dream and a talent.
[32:19.06]Look, I'm sorry.
If there's someone that you--
[32:29.84]He's a hemophiliac.
That would explain his obsession with blood.
[32:35.08]He can't bleed without a fear of dying.
It's also why he would separate the plasma from the blood
before painting with it.
[32:41.51]It's an antiquated treatment, but some hemophiliacs
can inject plasma into their wounds,
kick-starting the clotting process that's ineffective in their own systems.
[32:49.42]Talk about it.
Hey, girlie, I need a list of hemophiliacs in San Francisco.
Vague. So vague. Okay.
[32:57.16]Garcia, for his obsession to be this profound,
he most likely has the more severe version of the disease.
It's type B Christmas disease.
[33:04.10]Reid, happy to hear you made it safe and sound.
Thank you, Garcia.
Okay, Christmas disease. It does not sound very jolly.
[33:11.91]It was named after the first known case, Stephen Christmas.
All right, I got 15 people who have trouble clotting.
[33:17.25]He wouldn't stray too far from the art world.
Most likely works in and around the art community,
but not as an artist.
And he's a loner. So look for people with jobs
[33:23.55]where they don't interact with the public.
Yeah. Yeah. I got 3.
Stock boy at a local supermarket, an art blogger,
[33:29.76]and a custodian.
The victims have different blood types.
If he's taking the plasma out of the blood,
[33:36.50]he must be a universal recipient.
Any of them with AB-positive blood?
Specificity. I dig it.
[33:43.57]Okay, if I factor in those "B" names I was working on...
And bingo is his name-o.
[33:49.25]Actually, his name is Bryan Hughes.
He is an AB-positive hemophiliac
who works as a janitor at the Bay Area Museum of Art,
[33:55.49]and before you ask, yes, his address has been sent to your phones.
You're the best, baby girl.
Dave, you and Blake take the museum.
The rest of us will take the residence.
[34:06.50]I'm okay.
Yeah. But it's good to see you.
[34:12.57]You really don't need to be here if you're not ready.
This is going to take time.
[34:20.68]How much time?
It's hard to say.
But we're all here for you.
[34:28.48]Thank you.
[35:33.24][sirens]
Hey, what you got, mama?
A compelling piece of information about this Bryan Hughes.
[35:41.30]3 weeks before the first murder,
he was involved in a car accident.
Hotch: Was he injured?
Uh, no. And if you were looking at the pictures I am
[35:47.17]you would say that is a miracle.
It may have given him the impression he couldn't be hurt.
The other driver was hurt. She bled to death.
[35:54.75]Hughes called 911, failed to mention there was another driver involved.
By the time emergency crews got there,
thanks, Garcia. She had already died.
[36:00.08]Watching the other woman bleed to death must have been the trigger.
[Cell phone rings] Hey, what you got, pretty boy?
I think Hughes may have his next victim.
[36:07.69]An Alan archer just came in and reported his boss missing.
Madison Riley owns an art gallery in the Mission District.
[36:13.43]Said there was blood, signs of a struggle.
Hughes even left a painting of his on the wall this time.
It's the same signature and it's definitely made of blood,
[36:19.80]which got me thinking about Maeve's stalker.
If this guy's a tortured artist searching for approval,
[36:26.21]in his mind there may be only one way to get it.
Suicide.
Thanks, Reid.
[36:41.99]I put my heart and my soul into those paintings.
[36:50.06]You're going to get a first-hand look
at what I'm capable of creating.
[36:57.97]Bryan Hughes, FBI.
No! I have to make her see.
[37:03.24]Hotch: Put down the knife.
[37:09.05]Bryan, I understand.
No, you don't.
How could you possibly understand?
[37:15.56]Because I've seen your work.
And I know you may not be appreciated now,
but I promise you, if you put down the knife,
[37:22.20]I will make sure that people see your art,
and no one will be able to ignore it.
It's all I want. I deserve that.
[37:29.90]Then put down the knife, and let's figure this out.
[37:43.68]You know how many paintings van Gogh sold before he died?
Bryan, don't do it.
[37:50.89]Two.
He sold two.
[37:56.13]Don't make us do this.
[38:05.47]I gotta make you see me.
[38:15.01]Get the EMTs upstairs.
We've got another body over here.
[Gasping]
[38:57.72]Well, I counted 5 baskets.
7, but I think Ms. Cavanaugh next door
[39:03.72]may have taken a couple.
I'm really sorry if I've been kind of...
[39:09.43]Spence. You don't...
Kid.
I didn't mean for you to come all the way out there.
[39:17.30]I know.
Listen, if you need anything at all,
you just have to ask.
[39:25.58]Actually, if you guys don't mind,
I could use some help with something.
Name it.

but rather, learning to start over."
