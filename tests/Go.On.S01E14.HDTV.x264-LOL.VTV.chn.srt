只是賴安
It's just Ryan.

13
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,490
"只是賴安"  我也是有頭有臉的
"Just Ryan"? I matter.

14
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,820
看  我手機里有飛人博爾特的號碼
Look, I got Usain Bolt's phone number in my phone.

15
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,820
當今男子短跑霸主

16
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,220
瞧  是不是
Check it out. Look at that.

17
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,990
好吧  你們是愛我的  剛那什么意思
Okay, you guys love me. What is this?

18
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,210
西蒙回來了
Simone's back.

19
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,320
她是小組里出現過的
She's the most awesome, coolest person

20
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,730
最棒最酷的人
that's ever been in this group.

21
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,570
我想知道她又有什么悲劇
Ooh, I wonder what her new tragedy is.

22
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,240
我希望她丟了只貓
I hope she lost a cat.

23
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,100
跟西蒙分享悲劇簡直爽歪歪
Sharing a tragedy with Simone would be mint.

24
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,840
瞧瞧你們  穿的這么正式
Look at you guys. You're all dressed up.

25
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,130
安妮  你還穿裙子了
Anne, are you wearing a dress?

26
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,490
-她喜歡我的腿  -神啊
- She likes my legs. - Oh, boy.

27
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,900
我戴上了耳環
I put my earring back in

28
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,910
還把白頭發拔了拔
and had them take out a little of the gray.

29
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,510
她在那會兒  這小組就像天堂
When she was in the group, this was the place to be.

30
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,140
大家還都意氣風發
Anyone who was anyone was here.

31
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,320
踏歌而舞
And we danced.

32
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,330
你腦子里想的肯定是54錄音室吧
I'm fairly certain you're thinking of studio 54.

33
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,330
80年代Disco舞曲的風向標

34
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,170
看  西蒙就不會像你這樣
See, that's the kind of crack Simone would never make.

35
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,590
她會融入其中  金
She was in it, King.

36
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,390
不是高高在上的評判
Not above it, commenting on it.

37
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,990
只是我  抱歉  我不是西蒙
Just me. Sorry, I'm not Simone.

38
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,160
勞倫討厭西蒙
Lauren hates Simone.

39
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,310
我沒有討厭西蒙
I don't hate Simone.

40
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,620
沒準我想的確實是54錄音室
Maybe I was thinking about studio 54.

41
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,890
我是在這從迪克·卡維特手里搶女人的嗎
Did I steal a woman from Dick Cavett here?

42
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,890
60年代的著名主持人

43
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,070
西蒙一講故事
Whenever Simone tells a story,

44
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,400
她總在旁邊小聲嘀咕
she can't help but mutter under her breath.

45
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,940
勞倫會說  "沒這回事  西蒙
Lauren is, like, "That event not happen, Simone.

46
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,710
我不信  我快吐了"
I not believe this. Gag me with spoon."

47
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,310
你對我的印象太離奇了
Your impression of me is uncanny.

48
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,180
她只是喜歡做主角
She just demands a lot of attention.

49
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,380
還經常夸大其詞
And is prone to exaggeration.

50
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,930
一個欲求不滿的騙子
Ah, so a needy liar.

51
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,470
這種人你們都覺得比我好
That's who you think is better than me?

52
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,900
-伙計們  -天吶
- Guys... - Oh, my god!

53
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,760
她來了  她終于來了
She's here! She's finally here!

54
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,110
-西蒙  -西蒙
- Simone! - Simone!

55
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,140
她抱了我  她第一個抱了我
She hugged me. She's hugging me first.

56
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,620
我實在太高興了
Oh, I'm just so happy.

57
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,890
好棒
Yes!

58
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,360
我沒看出她欲求不滿啊
I don't see the appeal.

59
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,490
-我看出來了  -好吧  我也看出來了
- I do. - Yeah, me too.

60
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,900
我在馬拉喀什的集市上
I was in the bazaar in Marrakesh

61
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,480
看到了這九條最絢麗的披巾
when I saw the nine most colorful scarves

62
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,690
就想起了我認識的最多彩的九個人
and thought of the nine most colorful people I know.

63
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,420
安妮  你的眼睛好幽藍
Anne, your eyes look so blue.

64
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,120
是因為這披巾  無可挑剔的顏色
It's the scarf. It's the perfect color.

65
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,910
這些披巾把我們襯得好漂亮
The scarves are making us beautiful.

66
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,170
是你們讓披巾美麗起來
I think you make the scarves beautiful.

67
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,160
你一定是賴安了
And you must be Ryan.

68
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,260
我不需要披巾
Oh, I don't need a scarf.

69
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,310
我本身就很美
I'm already beautiful.

70
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,290
我沒有披巾了
I don't have a scarf,

71
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,770
但尤蘭達用電郵給我發了你的照片
but I had Yolanda email me a picture of you.

72
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,400
而我一向水彩不離身
Unfortunately, I'm never without my watercolors.

73
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,560
我喜歡
I love it.

74
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,980
那么西蒙
So Simone,

75
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,230
想和我們分享一下會回到小組的原因嗎
would you like to share with us why you returned?

76
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,420
是你哥哥陷入昏迷了嗎
Is your brother in a coma?

77
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,420
你們也知道  我第一次加入小組
As you know, I first joined this group

78
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,370
是因為一次意外受傷中斷了我的事業
when my career was cut short by a tragic injury.

79
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,630
我不得不向我的舞蹈生涯道別
And I had to say, "farewell" to dance.

80
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,590
其實根本沒有證據
Although there was no evidence

81
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,380
證明她受過傷  或跳過舞
of an injury or a dance career.

82
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,760
嘀嘀咕咕  跳過舞
Blah, blah, blah, blah. Dance career.

83
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,570
我唯有前進  探索未來
I left in search of the next thing.

84
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,810
我去了歐洲  找尋美麗
I went to europe, seeking beauty.

85
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,130
進行藝術創作...
I was making art--

86
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,030
忘了我已經回到美國了
I forgot I'm back in the states.

87
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,610
況且現在也不是1937年
And it's not 1937,

88
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,350
你也不是那只企鵝
and you're not the penguin.

89
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,350
1937年美國百樂香煙公司在煙盒中加入企鵝形象的漫畫卡片來做宣傳

90
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,180
你最好也笑出聲來  不然朋友沒得做
You better laugh at that, or we're not friends anymore.

91
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,660
我笑得眼淚要出來了
I'm torn about this.

92
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,410
我在塞納河邊描繪農莊的時候
I was sketching farm houses on the Seine

93
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,110
遇到了一位詩人  我的心靈伴侶
when I met a poet-- my soul mate.

94
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,960
咱能速度快點嗎
Can we speed this up?

95
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,670
我還有事想和大家討論呢
I've got some things I'd like to discuss.

96
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,260
我從未對一個人如此動心過
I had never fallen so hard for anybody.

97
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,830
于是我向他求婚了
I asked him to marry me.

98
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,060
但婚禮那天  他消失了
And on the day we were to wed, he disappeared.

99
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,480
-不是吧  -天吶
- Oh, no! - Ohh...

100
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,490
我心碎得無法用言語表達
Words do not exist to express my heartbreak.

101
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,900
不  不對
No, that's not true.

102
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,350
有一個古蓋爾語
There is an ancient Gaelic phrase.

103
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,920
[痛徹心扉]
Briseadh croi.

104
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,090
對  就是這個
Yeah. That's it.

105
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,790
謝謝你  本杰明
Thank you, Benjamin.

106
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,330
本杰明  你居然告訴她你真名
"Benjamin"? You told her your name?

107
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,360
我覺得她承受得住
I felt like she could handle it.

108
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,100
回來的感覺真是太好了
It feels good to be here.

109
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,560
不說我了  賴安有事要說
But enough about me. Ryan had something.

110
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,110
是啊  賴安  你還能說點啥
Yeah, Ryan. Follow that.

111
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,970
人家可剛失去了心中摯愛
She just lost the love of her life.

112
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,220
我的摯愛都死了
Mine died.

113
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,510
都好幾個月之前了  真沒勁
Yeah, like months ago. Uck.

114
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,730
你們都知道  工作是我宣泄情緒的通道
Well, as you all know, work has been a refuge.

115
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,680
我的秀是我的一切
My show is everything to me.

116
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,090
你辦藝術展嗎
Oh, you're in the arts?

117
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,890
是電臺的體育節目
Sports radio.

118
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,420
全是些比分啊  胸大無腦的運動員啊
It's all scores, boobies,

119
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,200
還有施瓦辛格時期的落后套話
and Schwarzenegger impressions.

120
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,610
廣告之后是更多橄欖球訊息
More NFL after the break.

121
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,470
我會回來的
I'll be back.

122
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,760
來  繼續說吧
Yeah, go ahead.

123
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,300
好啊
Okay.

124
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,560
本來應該做我精神支柱和摯友的史蒂文
Steven, who's supposed to be my advocate and best friend,

125
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,000
告訴我從現在開始
informs me that, from now on,

126
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,490
我的節目要被砍去15分鐘
my show is gonna be 15 minutes shorter.

127
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,110
你們能相信嗎  砍了15分鐘
Can you believe that? 15 minutes shorter.

128
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,000
西蒙  你現在住哪啊
So, Simone, where are you staying?

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,470
-能跟我一起住嗎  -跟我一起住吧
- Oh, will you stay with me? - Stay with me?

130
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,690
跟我住
Me!

131
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,300
安妮  我愿意跟你一起住
Anne, I'd love to stay with you.

132
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,380
太棒了
Yeah!

133
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,910
孩子們都不在家  我把我房間讓給你
The kids are away. I'll--I'll give you my room.

134
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,260
我堅持這樣做
I insist.

135
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,930
你確定不想跟我同床共枕嗎
You sure you don't want to share a bed?

136
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,150
西蒙  別逗我了
Simone. Silly.

137
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,600
我話還沒說完呢
I'm in the middle of saying something.

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,990
有人聽我講話嗎
Is anybody listening to me?

139
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,040
我聽著呢
I am.

140
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,580
史蒂文本來是你朋友
Steven was your friend.

141
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,070
但他卻將你的體育節目
And then he cut your sports show

142
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,750
從三小時砍到兩小時45分鐘
from 3 hours to 2 hours and 45 minutes.

143
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,210
這是最嚴重的背叛
That is the ultimate betrayal.

144
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,550
你的冤情將得昭雪
And you will be avenged.

145
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,030
唯一聽我講話的還是這副瘋樣
And there goes the only person who listens to me.

146
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,560
我的錯
My bad.

147
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,610
抱歉用后背扎了你的劍
Sorry I hit your sword with my back.

148
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,600
來  丹尼  我來幫你
Here, Danny. Let me help you.

149
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,810
謝了
Thanks.

150
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,720
這些是離婚文件嗎
Hey, are these divorce papers?

151
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,720
你終于給那劈腿狐貍精來點厲害的了
You're finally giving that cheating harpy the boot.

152
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,960
我不能說我很崇拜你
I--no, I can't say that I respect you,

153
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,760
但你的形象沒有以前那么卡通了
but you seem less like a cartoon dog to me.

154
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,240
-真的嗎  -是呀
- Really? - Mm-hmm.

155
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,460
是啊  是該向前看了
Yeah, time to move on.

156
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,370
偷偷告訴你  我正暗戀小組里的某人
Between us, I'm sweet on somebody in the group.

157
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,770
我現在是春心萌動少年情愁啊
I am developing the darndest, most confusing feelings.

158
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,390
大齡男還能少年情懷總是癡  不容易
This innocent, mayberry sexuality on an old guy--mm.

159
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,880
丹尼  為什么這些文件
Danny, why is this paperwork

160
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,080
說的全是她將分到的財產啊
all about what she is gonna get?

161
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,380
誰是你的律師啊
Who the hell is your lawyer?

162
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,610
是邦妮請的  人很好
Oh, some nice guy Bonnie picked out.

163
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,790
你妻子請的
Your wife?

164
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,360
對啊  我們倆用的都是他
Yeah. We're both using him.

165
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,100
這樣多省事  對吧
Makes things easier, don't you think?

166
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,780
你好啊  索尼婭
Oh, hey, Sonia.

167
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,970
你知道丹尼正在辦離婚嗎
Did you know Danny is getting a divorce?

168
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,390
很明顯  他喜歡上了一個小組成員
Apparently, he likes someone in the group.

169
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,210
真的嗎
Really?

170
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,160
他要被凈身出戶了
Oh, he's gonna get taken to the cleaners.

171
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,060
你能幫幫他嗎  你辦離婚案嗎
Can you help him? Do you do divorces?

172
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,970
我是個訴訟律師
I'm a prosecutor.

173
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,520
我將罪犯綁上電椅
I put sleazebags in the chair

174
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,530
讓他們與世界吻別
and divorce them from existence.

175
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
你考慮考慮幫幫丹尼吧
I want you to think about helping Danny.

176
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,540
不過最重要的是
But more importantly,

177
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,610
我能去參觀執行死刑嗎
can I come to an execution?

178
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,490
不  你至少得先試一次
No, you gotta give it a try just once.

179
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,580
-你好  K佬  -下午好  卡麗
- Hi, Mr. K. - Good afternoon, Carrie.

180
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,930
見到你真高興
Wonderful to see you.

181
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,420
抽你的每一下
That is one slap

182
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,040
都是為了你從賴安身上奪走的七分半鐘
for every 7 and half minutes you took from Ryan.

183
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,890
搞什么嘛
What the hell?

184
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,390
史蒂文  快看你的車
Steven, look at your car.

185
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,960
我的愛車啊
Sweetheart.

186
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,460
嘿  勞倫
 Oh, hey, Lauren.

187
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,730
-天啊  -原來你在這啊
- Oh, God. - There you are.

188
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,950
合十禮[印度禮儀]
Namaste.

189
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,150
你來這干嗎
What are you doing here?

190
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,230
沒聽說過私人空間這一說嗎
You've never heard of boundaries?

191
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,700
西蒙這么整不行啊
Simone's not working out.

192
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,890
她就要掌控整個小組了
She's taken over the group.

193
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,790
我知道你也煩心
I know it bothers you.

194
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,630
-我能看出你在生悶氣  -我沒有生悶氣
- I can tell you're pent up. - I'm not pent up.

195
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,870
你知道現在西蒙在干啥么
You know where Simone is right now?

196
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,350
她正和組員們在安妮的家里
She's at Anne's house with the group,

197
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,400
描繪彼此的美麗
so that they can paint each other's beauty.

198
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,090
啥
What?

199
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,500
她還發給我一首勵志詩
She sent me an inspirational poem.

200
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,260
寫得爛透了  這明明是你的招數
That stuff sucks. That's your stuff.

201
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,760
-你才是大爛人啊  -是啊
- You get to suck. - Yeah.

202
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,840
我們得把她從小組中驅除
We need to eliminate her from the group.

203
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,670
賴安  我要給你
Ryan, I'm gonna give you

204
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,270
和福斯塔在你第一次小組討論后
the same piece of advice I gave to Fausta

205
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,050
想要把你踢走時
when she wanted to fusilart you

206
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,170
我曾給她的建議
after your first session.

207
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,100
什么
What?

208
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,670
調整心態  繼續前進
Filed away. Keep going.

209
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,110
什么都別做
Do nothing.

210
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,310
相信我  相信小組
Trust me. Trust the group.

211
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,670
終有一天...
And in time...

212
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,390
賴安  你來了
Ryan, you came.

213
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,850
拿支畫筆  找一位你認為美麗的人
Grab a paintbrush and find someone you think is beautiful.

214
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,180
身邊的人就行
You won't have to look far.

215
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,950
-不會有用的  -什么
- It's not working out. - What?

216
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,330
你對小組使的那些技倆
You. The group.

217
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,180
自從我加入之后整個小組都高歌猛進
We've hit a nice stride since I joined.

218
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,340
你不適合我們
You don't fit.

219
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,360
你讀了我發給你的詩了嗎
Did you read the poem I sent you?

220
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,010
我才沒讀那首蠢詩呢
No, I didn't read the stupid poem

221
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,910
那個什么"呀疵"寫的
You sent me by "Yee-ahts."

222
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,420
我知道應該念葉慈
I realize it's pronounced Yeats,

223
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,420
葉慈  愛爾蘭著名詩人

224
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,900
我就是要故意念錯  削弱這名字的氣勢
But I'm mispronouncing it to take away its power.

225
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,230
你反應過激了  我們能夠和平相處的
You're overreacting. There's room for both of us.

226
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,410
你錯了
You are wrong.

227
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,850
都聽著  我有話要說
Everybody, a word.

228
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,050
賴安  我們發現了美
Ryan, we find beauty.

229
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,790
-我畫了歐文  -他是裸著的
- I draw Owen. - He's naked.

230
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,730
沒必要畫裸體像  真心的
Doesn't need to be. Is.

231
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,540
繪畫時間結束  讓她走人
Painting time's over. She's gotta go.

232
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,200
不不不  賴安  這可是西蒙
No, no, no. Ryan, this is Simone.

233
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,980
尤蘭達才是那個多余的人
Yolanda is the one who we don't want.

234
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,650
行了  你根本幫不上忙
Okay, that is not helping.

235
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,320
掀翻我朋友的車也不叫幫忙
Nor did it help when you turned my friend's car upside-down.

236
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,720
這是一種很不得體的行為
That is not appropriate human behavior.

237
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,970
好吧
Okay.

238
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,520
那我們來討論一下什么叫得體的行為
Can we just say what is appropriate human behavior?

239
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,280
干嘛小題大做  我們喜歡西蒙
Why all the drama? We like Simone.

240
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,740
好吧  我也不想這么做
All right. I don't want to do this.

241
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,950
但你們必須做出選擇
But you're gonna have to choose.

242
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,420
有她沒我  懂嗎
Her or me, okay?

243
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,590
我相信你們都會選擇我的
And I think you will all choose me.

244
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,840
除了現場某位豐腴的女士
Except for a certain buxom someone

245
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,470
我聽說她很早以前就想把我轟出去了
who I heard has already tried to have me eliminated.

246
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,440
他知道了
He knows.

247
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,130
你們到底選誰
So what's it gonna be?

248
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,780
她還是我
Her or me?

249
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,470
嗨  勞倫
Hey, Lauren.

250
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,260
記得我答應過你不會做的那件事嗎
Remember that thing I said I wasn't gonna do?

251
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,560
-我做了  還失敗了  -那是歐文嗎
- It didn't go well. - Is that Owen?

252
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,620
是的
Oh, yeah.

253
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,770
福斯塔給我的安慰獎
Fausta gave it to me as a consolation prize.

254
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,860
-不是很管用啊  -對  感覺更糟了
- Doesn't make it better. - No, it makes it worse.

255
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,290
我的客戶  你的妻子
My client, your wife,

256
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,820
向你索要如下財產
is asking for the following in the divorce.

257
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,790
房子  我的車
House, my car.

258
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,460
我的軍人撫恤金
My military pension.

259
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,490
感覺像被敲了竹杠一樣
Seems like I might be getting rooked here.

260
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,820
你是我的律師  你怎么說
You're my lawyer. What do you think?

261
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,640
我認為我們還是接受的好
I think we gotta take it.

262
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,850
我付給你的錢真沒白花
It's why I pay you the big bucks.

263
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,020
丹尼  把筆放下
Danny, put down the pen!

264
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,610
快滾開  你這個開保時捷
Back off, you porsche-driving,

265
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,670
住冷水峽谷豪宅
coldwater canyon mansion-living,

266
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,570
哈佛畢業的狗娘養的敗類
Harvard name-dropping mother [beep]!

267
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,320
他有新律師了

268
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,740
-你愿意幫我  -是的
- You're gonna help me? - Yeah.

269
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,860
你人好好哦
You're so sweet.

270
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,160
你可不能讓他這么想
Well...you can't let him think that.

271
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,460
這下我只能...
Now I have to--

272
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,850
氣勢回來了
balance restored.

273
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,250

如何能輕易被瓦解

276
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,060
今天的嘉賓是泰瑞爾·歐文斯
Our guest, Terrell Owens.

277
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,650
泰瑞爾  你在牛仔隊時
Terrell, so when you were with the Cowboys--

278
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,130
我以為你請我來是為了上次
I thought you brought me here to apologize

279
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,780
朝我亂扔水果的事情道歉
for throwing fruit at me the last time.

280
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,890
好吧  很抱歉朝你亂扔水果
Right. Sorry about that fruit thing.

281
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,930
你在牛仔隊時
So when you were with the Cowboys,

282
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,540
牛仔隊可是超級碗隊伍  但是
they were a Super Bowl contender, but...

283
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,330
道歉太沒誠意了
That apology didn't feel genuine.

284
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,430
我是個人  賴安
I'm a person, Ryan.

285
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,210
不是你常說的
Not a robot in, like,

286
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,680
施瓦辛格電影里的機器人
those Schwarzenegger movies you always talk about.

287
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,070
好吧  我們來電話連線吧
Okay, well, we're gonna go to the phones.

288

這位是來自里西達的約翰
We've got John from Reseda.

289
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,730
賴安  我是西蒙
Ryan, it's Simone.

290
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,300
我覺得你對我誤會大發了
I feel your impression of me is way off base.

291
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,290
我懂的  西蒙
Been there, Simone.

292
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,980
我覺得你應該給我個機會  賴安
I think you should give me a chance, Ryan.

293
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,600
我周身散發的都是愛啊
I spread awesomeness.

294
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,900
我們得找個晚上好好聊聊
Let's go out one night.

295
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,550
不是談這個的時候
We are not doing this right now.

296
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,980
她惹到你了
Oh, she's under your skin?

297
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,980
聲音挺迷人的  長得怎么樣
She sounds attractive. Is she attractive?

298
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,430
那什么  我們要插播一條廣告
You know what? We gonna go to a commercial,

299
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,120
這事我們要線下解決
and we're gonna figure this out off the air.

300
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,330

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,150
好吧  特雷爾  你可以撤了
All right, Terrell. We're done.

302
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,510
你一個人搞不定的
You need help.

303
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,320
這他媽是...
What the--

304
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,400
你居然畫我  伙計
Did you paint a picture of me, man?

305
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,520
你好
Hi.

306
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,220
你離我遠點
You stay away from me.

307
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,290
-你知道我的  -不  我不知道
- Look, you know me. - No, I don't know.

308
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,140
你知道要我說出我"次臥了"是很難的
And you know I have a hard time saying I'm-- w-rong.

309
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,690
讓我接受指責很簡單
It's easy for me to accept blame.

310
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,710
但我對于不發音的"W"有著認知問題
I just have a cognitive problem with my silent "W"s.

311
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,340
奇怪的是
It's weird,

312
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,050
"洗爺下"它們倒是一點問題沒有
I don't have any trouble w-riting them.

313
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,130
我要改過自新

-這是誰干的  -行了

323
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,850
K佬  我壓根沒生你的氣
Mr. K, I'm not even mad at you.

324
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,380
事實上  我氣的是賴安
I'm actually mad at Ryan.

325
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,530
我都為他做牛做馬了
I kill myself for the guy,

326
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,820
他居然還背著我埋汰我
and he complains about me behind my back.

327
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,290
他不知道我承受的壓力有多大
He doesn't understand the pressure I face

328
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,490
廣告銷售  聽眾流失等等
from ad sales, from audience erosion--

329
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,480
不說了  算了
You know, forget it.

330
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,790
我不想用電臺業的細枝末節煩你
I don't want to bore you with the minutia of the radio business.

別別別
No, no, no.

332
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,710
我就喜歡細枝末節  都跟我說說
I love minutia. Explain it all to me.

333
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,170
-你說真的  -要記筆記嗎
- Seriously? - May I take notes?

334
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,650
不用  你沒必要做這個
No. You don't have to do that.

335
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,210
卡麗  把這記下來
Carrie, take this down.

336
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,640
丹尼  我讓你寫張你想要東西的清單

340
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,260
抱歉

如果你想這么上法庭

351
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,970
我會把你當午飯吃了

352
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,590
你又不是離婚律師
You're not a divorce attorney.

353
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,290
這是我的專長
This is my specialty.

354
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,270

我能讓他們
Yeah, I can rile them up

359
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,670
因曾經的不公而激憤得跳腳
over the injustice that's been done.

360
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,800
或者讓他們開懷大笑

我也能讓他們哭

00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,070
因為對這個有著1/64
over the betrayal

00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,800
印第安奇努克血統的人的背叛

請再來兩杯酒  沙琳

376
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,720
老一套的胸牌花招
Ah, yes, the old clocking of the name tag trick.

377
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,780
我媽也這么干  其實沒人想被這么對待
My mom does that. Nobody wants it.

378
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,120
如果我們和沙琳的聯系

379
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,130

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,350
我呸
Um...Yuck.

383
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,280
讓我們深入了解一下  真心話還是大冒險
Let's deepen our connection. Truth or dare?

384
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,170
你知道我們不是14歲吧
You realize we're not 14 years old, right?

385
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,840
-真心話大冒險  傻子  -好吧  真心話
- Truth or dare, dummy. - Fine, truth.

386
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,170
你和你妻子在哪遇見的
Where'd you meet your wife?

387
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,190
我的第一個廣播站工作
My first radio job.

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,820
她是電臺經理的女兒
She was the daughter of the station manager,

389
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,450
他討厭我  我就約詹妮出去
and he hated me, and I asked Janie out.

390
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,770
我想她只是為了氣他  所以她同意了
And, I think just to spite him, she said "Yes."

391
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,450
我覺得這是她跟我結婚的原因
I think that's why she married me.

392
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,850
以及我有六塊腹肌
That and the fact that I have a six-pack.

393
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,300
但是為了能讓人看見  我得把身體里的
But in order to see it, I have to breathe

394
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,450
空氣全都呼出去
all the air out of my body,

395
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,420
然后再用力地咳嗽
and then cough, like, really hard.

396
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,110
-真心話大冒險  -大冒險

397

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,500
賴安  這是第一次
Wow, Ryan, that's the first dare

400
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,540
我聽到的大冒險不涉及到讓我脫衣服
I've ever heard that doesn't invol meve taking my clothes off.

401
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,600
說實在的
Well, in fairness to me,

402
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,370
我沒意識到那也是個選擇
I didn't realize that was an option.

403
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,580
沙琳  我們在一起很開心
Charlene, we've had a great time,

404
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,910
我不想就這么結束
and I don't want it to end.

405
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,280
告訴我你的電話號碼好嗎
Why don't you give me your number?

406
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,100
你不會遺憾的  我很會愛撫
You won't be sorry. I know how to do stuff.

407
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,030
我也很會愛撫  沙琳
I know how to do stuff too, Charlene.

408
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,720
很好  做得不錯
All right, that was good. Nicely done.

409
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,170
你選大冒險我并不驚訝
Not surprised you picked "dare" though.

410
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,340
你看起來就不想愛說真心話的
You don't seem to be that big a fan of truth.

411
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,380
好的  想要個免費的真心話嗎
Fine, you want a free truth?

412
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,160
好啊  那就談談你的未婚夫吧
Okay. Let's talk about your fiance.

413
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,860
你的今生摯愛
The love of your life.

414
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,340
他生日是什么時候  他最喜歡什么顏色
When's his birthday? What's his favorite color?

415
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,530
門基樂隊沒有被選入搖滾名人堂
Is he outraged that The Monkees

416
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,750
他有沒有很生氣
are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

417
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,160
這些事我都不知道
I don't know any of those things.

418
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,890
我才認識他24小時
I only knew him for 24 hours.

419
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,070
悲劇了你
Aha! Tepid tragedy.

420
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,420
那就意味著他不是我今生摯愛嗎
Does that mean that he wasn't the love of my life?

421
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,960
你花了多長時間愛上
How long did it take for you

422
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,730
你的今生摯愛的
to fall for the love of your life?

423
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,360
不太長
Not long.

424
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,630
暴風雨要來了
There's a storm coming.

425
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,670
我跳舞的腿總是能感覺到
I can always feel it in my dance leg.

426
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,900
真的嗎  你在洛杉磯是預測暴風雨的
Really? You calling your shot with a storm in L.A.?

427
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,280
腿不會騙人
Leg never lies.

428
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,280
女士  你要么是我遇見過的最有趣人
Lady, you are either the most interesting person

429
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,820
要么就是一個病態撒謊精
I've ever met or a pathological liar.

430
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,710
我選真心話
I'll take truth.

431
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
你因為什么而受不了我
What about me makes you so crazy?

432
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,320
-你真想知道嗎  -是的
- You really want to know? - Mm-hmm.

433
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,490
我在這世上最親近的人
Okay, the person that I was

434
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,820
已經死了
closest to in the world died.

435
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,930
我想表現得很淡定
And I try to keep it all cool and together,

436
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,680
但是大多數的早晨
but most mornings, it's a miracle

437
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,430
我能下床都是奇跡了
I can even get out of bed.

438
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,200
救助小組真的幫了很大的忙
And that group really helps me.

439
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,930
我不知道方式  也不知道原因
I don't know how. I don't know why.

440
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,000
但是我不想讓你來搗亂
But I don't want you messing with that.

441
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,370
跟我來
Come with me.

442
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,160
可見效果加上投資回報率
The viewable impressions plus the ROI should equal

443
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,890
應該等于廣告效果
advertising effectiveness.

444
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,550
但是在這個不斷進步的世界中
But in a world of time-shifted content,

445
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,440
舊有的規則已經不適用了
the older rules no longer apply.

446
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,780
你在和歷史的挑戰相"布窩"斗
You are w-restling with historic challenges.

447
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,210
你懂的
You get it!

448
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,830
你是第一個愿意花時間去理解的人
You're the first person that's ever taken the time to understand.

449
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,090
謝了  兄弟
Thanks, buddy.

450
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,350
我們是兄弟了
Are we buddies?

451
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,970
-我能叫你兄弟嗎  -當然了
- Can I call you buddy? - Yeah, sure.

452
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,280
哦  兄弟
Oh, buddy.

453
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,180
這是我人生最輝煌的時刻了  兄弟
This is the best moment of my life, buddy.

454
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,600
現在去干什么
Huh? What now?

455
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,730
去整蠱一對關系沒有咱們好的兄弟嗎
Should we go pull a prank on some lesser pair of buddies?

456
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,340
我想要教訓一下賴安
I would like to teach Ryan

457
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,070
因為他不把我當回事
a lesson about taking me for granted.

458
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,670
你們是在說要教訓賴安嗎
Are we talking about teaching ryan a lesson?

459
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,640
-是的  -我入伙
- Yeah. - I'm in.

460
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,680
安妮是個奇跡創造者
Anne is a miracle worker.

461
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,420
我基本上得到了一切
I basically get everything.

462
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,250
所以你恢復單身了  太激動人心了
So you're gonna be single. That's exciting.

463
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,250
或許你可以當我的副手
Maybe you could be my wingman.

464
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,820
讓我確認一下
Let me check something.

465
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,850
應該沒多大競爭力
You wouldn't be too much competition.

466
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,860
我只要簽個名就好了
All I have to do is sign here, and it is official.

467
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,310
放下筆  丹尼  我們還能要更多
Put down that pen, Danny. We're gonna get more.

468
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,970
更多
More?

469
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,550
你買給她的珠寶
The jewelry that you gave her,

470
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,480
她爺爺奶奶的儲蓄債券
those savings bonds from her grandparents.

471
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,240
還有她用你的醫保治療的橫隔膜
The diaphragm that she got using your health coverage.

472
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,310
我不想要她的橫隔膜
I don't want a diaphragm.

473
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,880
賣了它  換一頂圓頂小帽
Well, sell it. Use it for a yarmulke.

474
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,940
就要到手了
We're getting it.

475
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,290
你不想因她的所做所為而報復她嗎
Don't you want her to suffer for what she did to you?

476
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,090
不  我希望自己能向前看
No, I just want to move on.

477
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,080
丹尼  那女人曾宣誓過
Danny, the woman made a vow.

478
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,250
她曾承諾  不管貧困富裕
She promised to be there through good times and bad,

479
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,960
都會永遠在你身邊
by your side, forever.

480
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,020
她不會因為日子趨于平淡而離開你
She doesn't get to leave because she gets bored,

481
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,540
也不會因結識新歡拋棄你
or she finds someone new,

482
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,590
亦或是忘記吃那該死的心臟病藥
or she forgets to take her damn heart medication!

483
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,230
你知道的  安妮
You know, Anne,

484
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,920
看起來你一開始的話題是一個女人
it seems like you could start talking about one woman,

485
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,270
-但最后卻變成了...  -我們都知道的
- but end up talking about-- - Yeah, we're already there.

486
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,300
感覺就像嗨了
This all feels very the wire.

487
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,890
-我們得到了嗎  -沒有
- Are we about to get "got"? - We don't get got.

488
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,160
我帶你去聚會  你或者我能艷遇
I take you to a meet so you get got or I get got,

489
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,030
但我們不能同時有艷遇  規矩就是這樣
but we don't both get got, 'cause it's not how it works.

490
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,560
是啊  我不怎么看那節目
Yeah, I don't actually watch the show.

491
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,970
我知道我本該如此
I know I'm supposed to.

492
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,060
你問我為什么帶你來這里
You asked me why I took you here.

493
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,730
如果你不是這么個人的話  我送你的詩
I sent you a poem that would be perfect for this

494
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,630
正好契合這個場景
if you weren't such a dude.

495
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,170
這世上充滿神奇的事物
The world is full of magical things,

496
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,260
耐心等待著我們用智慧...
patiently waiting for our senses...

497
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,980
去挖掘
to grow sharper.

498
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,670
-你果然讀了  -是的
- You did read it. - Yeah.

499
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,740
我告訴過你的
I told you.

500
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,770
還認為我在耍你玩嗎
Still think I'm full of it?

501
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,510
我不確定我是否還在意
I'm not certain I care.

502
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,650
很顯然
And it's pretty clear

503
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,340
你對帕蒂依舊充滿怨恨
you still have a lot of anger towards Patty.

504
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,730
那當然
Of course I do.

505
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,780
如果她真的愛我
If she really loved me,

506
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,860
她就會照顧好自己
she would have taken care of herself.

507
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,690
你不該給她太大壓力
You ought to cut her some slack.

508
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,820
我有六個心愛的孫子孫女
I got six grandchildren I love.

509
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,560
但我還是做著對自己沒啥好處的事
But I still do things that are bad for me.

510
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,000
要是有人給我搭線  我也挺愿意販毒的
Hell, I'd drop "E" if somebody would hook me up.

511
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,220
那是不可能的  喬治
It's not happening, George.

512
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,640
我都不敢睡在我們床上
I can't even sleep in our bed

513
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,050
那會讓我想起從前每晚我都會問
because it reminds me how every night I would say,

514
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,510
"你吃藥了嗎"
"Did you take your pill?"

515
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,340
她會親我  當著我的面撒謊
She would kiss me, lie to my face,

516
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,430
"吃了"
and say, "Yes."

517
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,710
你得學會舒緩情緒
You have to let that anger go.

518
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,250
你知道為什么我不恨邦妮了嗎
You know what allows me not to hate Bonnie?

519
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,950
因為你在基本訓練時
Blunt force trauma to your prefrontal cortex

520
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,730
前額皮質受到了創傷嗎
suffered during basic training?

521
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,940
不  那只留下了空間辨識問題
No. That just left me with a few minor spatial issues.

522
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,050
而邦妮  當她做的錯事
With Bonnie, when something she's done wrong

523
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,240
闖入我的腦袋時
pops into my head,

524
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,940
我會立即回憶起我們從前的開心時刻
I immediately think of all the good times we had together.

525
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,540
你覺得晚上
Do you think you can try sleeping

526
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,910
能試著睡回自己床上嗎
in your own bed tonight?

527
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,400
我不知道自己準備好沒
I don't know if I'm ready.

528
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,580
這里  就在這里
Here. It's right here.

529
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,990
你們說過會一直陪著我
You know, you said you would be here for me.

530
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,870
我不知道是字面上的意思
I didn't think you were being literal.

531
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,570
這個小組的人不太會暗喻
This group does not do well with metaphors.

532
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,780
再說了  我們做了"第一晚回床"蛋糕
Plus, we made you a first-night-in-your-bed cake.

533
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,640
福斯塔  這蛋糕美味極了
This cake is delicious, Fausta.

534
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,530
我的秘訣是
My secret:

535
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,030
我多加了一杯黃糖
I use an extra cup of brown sugar

536
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,870
還有母乳
and breast milk.

537
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,910
好吧  我告訴你們
Okay, you know what?

538
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,240
我改變注意了
I've changed my mind.

539
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,610
今晚我做不到
I don't think I can do this tonight.

540
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,770
等等  你可以的  安妮
Wait. You can do it, Anne.

541
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,200
回憶一下歡樂時光
Think about the good times.

542
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,790
你是對的
You're right.

543
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,510
謝謝你們
Thank you, guys.

544
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,410
我做得到  真的
I can do it, I can-- aah!

545
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,210
不  異性戀
Oh, no! Straight sex!

546
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,170
這是我邁出的很大一步
This is a very big step for me.

547
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,350
為什么在這里
Why here?

548
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,480
我們那時在這里道別
We were saying good night.

549
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,100
然后順理成章了
One thing led to another.

550
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,820
伙計們
Guys.

551
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,000
拜托了
Please.

552
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,810
讓我們聊一下真實感受
Let's talk about how we're all feeling.

553
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,660
我們聽著呢
We're listening.

554
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,140
很高興能和你共度一晚
I'm glad I could experience this night with you.

555
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,820
還有組內的一些人
And several members of the group.

556
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,790
我可不太受得了福斯塔那句
I could have done without Fausta saying,

557
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,600
"下一個我上"
"I got next."

558
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,130
她說的是你還是我
Did she mean me or you?

559
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,140
我  你都有安妮了
Me. You get Anne.

560
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,470
福斯塔是我的
Fausta's mine.

561
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,550
晚安
Good night.
