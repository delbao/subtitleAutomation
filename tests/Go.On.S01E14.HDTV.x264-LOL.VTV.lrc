[00:02.26][All groaning]
It's just Ryan.
"Just Ryan"? I matter.
[00:09.05]Look, I got Usain Bolt's phone number in my phone.
Check it out. Look at that.
Okay, you guys love me. What is this?
[00:16.50]Simone's back.
She's the most awesome, coolest person
that's ever been in this group.
Ooh, I wonder what her new tragedy is.
[00:23.10]I hope she lost a cat.
Sharing a tragedy with Simone would be mint.
Look at you guys. You're all dressed up.
[00:29.51]Anne, are you wearing a dress?
- She likes my legs. - Oh, boy.
[Laughs]
[00:35.01]I put my earring back in
and had them take out a little of the gray.
All: Ooh!
[00:41.19]When she was in the group, this was the place to be.
Anyone who was anyone was here.
And we danced.
[00:47.89]I'm fairly certain
you're thinking of Studio 54.
See, that's the kind of crack
Simone would never make.
[00:53.73]She was in it, King.
Not above it, commenting on it.
[All gasp]
[00:59.37][All groan]
Just me. Sorry, I'm not Simone.
Lauren hates Simone.
[01:05.54]I don't hate Simone.
Maybe I was thinking about Studio 54.
Did I steal a woman from dick cavett here?
[01:11.38]Whenever Simone tells a story,
she can't help
but mutter under her breath. [Scoffs] Oh.
Lauren is, like, "that event not happen, Simone.
[01:18.32]I not believe this. Gag me with spoon."
Your impression of me is uncanny.
She just demands a lot of attention.
[01:25.90]And is prone to exaggeration.
Ah, so a needy liar.
That's who you think is better than me?
[01:31.27]- Guys... - [Gasps] Oh, my God!
She's here! She's finally here!
Simone! Simone!
[Laughs]
[01:37.78]She hugged me. She's hugging me first.
Oh, I'm just so happy.
Yes!
[01:43.35]I don't see the appeal.
- I do. - Yeah, me too.
[Rock music]
[01:49.96]I was in the bazaar in Marrakesh
when I saw the nine most colorful scarves
and thought of the nine most colorful people I know.
[01:57.00]All: Aww.
Anne, your eyes look so blue.
It's the scarf. It's the perfect color.
[02:04.67]The scarves are making us beautiful.
I think you make the scarves beautiful.
All: Aww.
[02:10.61]And you must be Ryan.
Oh, I don't need a scarf.
I'm already beautiful.
I don't have a scarf,
but I had Yolanda email me a picture of you.
[02:17.32]Unfortunately, I'm never without my watercolors.
[Scoffs]
I love it.
[02:24.09]So Simone,
would you like to share with us why you returned?
Is your brother in a coma?
As you know, I first joined this group
[02:30.73]when my career was cut short by a tragic injury.
And I had to say, "farewell" to dance.
[02:37.67]Although there was no evidence of an injury or a dance career.
Blah, blah, blah, blah. Dance career.
I left in search of the next thing.
[02:44.08]I went to Europe, seeking beauty.
I was making art...
Mmmm.
I forgot I'm back in the states.
[02:51.55][Laughter]
And it's not 1937,
and you're not the penguin.
[02:58.39]You better laugh at that, or we're not friends anymore.
[Forced laugh] I'm torn about this.
[03:05.76][Laughing continues]
I was sketching farm houses on the seine
when I met a poet... My soul mate.
[03:11.70]Can we speed this up?
I've got some things I'd like to discuss.
I had never fallen so hard for anybody.
I asked him to marry me.
[03:19.11]And on the day we were to wed,
he disappeared.
- Oh, no! - Ohh...
Words do not exist to express my heartbreak.
[03:27.02]No, that's not true.
There is an ancient Gaelic phrase.
Uh briseadh croi.
[Whispers] Yeah.
[03:33.33]That's it.
Thank you, Benjamin.
"Benjamin"? You told her your name?
I felt like she could handle it.
[03:40.77]It feels good to be here.
But enough about me. Ryan had something.
Yeah, Ryan. Follow that.
[03:46.84]She just lost the love of her life.
Mine died.
Yeah, like mont ago. Uck.
[03:53.48]Well, as you all know, work has been a refuge.
My show is everything to me.
- Oh, you're in the arts? - [Scoffs]
[04:00.29]Sports radio.
It's all scores, boobies,
and Schwarzenegger impressions.
[As Schwarzenegger] More NFL after the break.
[04:07.13]I'll be back. [Gags]
[Laughter]
Yeah, go ahead.
[04:14.27][Mocking laugh] Okay.
Steven, who's supposed to be
my advocate and best friend,
informs me that, from now on,
[04:20.74]my show is gonna be 15 minutes shorter.
Can you believe that? 15 minutes shorter.
[04:26.81]So, Simone, where are you staying?
- Oh, will you stay with me? - Stay with me?
Me!
[04:32.99]Anne, I'd love to stay with you.
Yeah!
The kids are away. I'll... I'll give you my room.
[04:38.62]I insist.
You sure you don't want to share a bed?
Oh! [Scoffs]
[Both laugh]
Simone. Silly.
[04:45.66]I'm in the middle of saying something.
Is anybody listening to me?
I am.
Steven was your friend.
And then he cut your sports show
[04:52.90]from 3 hours to 2 hours and 45 minutes.
That is the ultimate betrayal.
[04:59.91]And you will be avenged.
♪ Dirty deeds done dirt cheap ♪
[05:05.12]♪ dirty deeds ♪
And there goes the only person who listens to me.
[05:14.65]My bad, sorry.
I hit your sword with my back.
Here, Danny. Let me help you.
Thanks.
[05:20.96]Hey, are these divorce papers?
[Gasps] You're finally giving
that cheating harpy the boot.
[05:26.70]I... no, I can't say that I respect you,
but you seem less like a cartoon dog to me.
- Really? - Mm-hmm.
[05:32.40]Yeah, time to move on.
Between us,
I'm sweet on somebody in the group.
I am developing the darndest,
[05:39.11]most confusing feelings.
This innocent, mayberry sexuality on an old guy... mm.
[05:45.25]Danny, why is this paperwork
all about what she is gonna get?
Who the hell is your lawyer?
Oh, some nice guy Bonnie picked out.
[05:51.89]Your wife?
Yeah. We're both using him.
Makes things easier, don't you think?
[05:58.93][Sighs]
Oh, hey, Sonia.
Did you know Danny is getting a divorce?
[06:05.10]Apparently, he likes someone in the group.
Really?
Oh, he's gonna get taken to the cleaners.
Can you help him? Do you do divorces?
[06:12.51]I'm a prosecutor.
I put sleazebags in the chair
and divorce them from existence.
I want you to think about helping Danny.
[06:18.98]Oh.
But more importantly,
can I come to an execution?
No, you gotta give it a try just once.
[06:25.79]Hi, Mr. K. Good afternoon, Carrie.
Wonderful to see you.
[Slapping]
[06:31.66]That is one slap for every 7 1/2 minutes
you took from Ryan.
Hmm.
[06:37.47]What the hell?
Steven, look at your car.
[06:43.01][Gasps]
Sweetheart.
♪ Dirty deeds done dirt cheap ♪
[06:51.05]♪ dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap ♪
♪ dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap ♪
[07:00.43]Oh, hey, Lauren.
- Oh, God. - There you are.
Namaste.
What are you doing here?
You've never heard of boundaries?
[07:06.46]Simone's not working out.
- [Sighs] - She's taken over the group.
I know it bothers you.
I can tell you're pent up. I'm not pent up.
You know where Simone is right now?
[07:13.17]She's at Anne's house with the group,
so that they can paint each other's beauty.
What?
She sent me an inspirational poem.
That stuff sucks. That's your stuff.
[07:20.58]- You get to suck. - Yeah.
We need to eliminate her from the group.
Ryan, I'm gonna give you
[07:26.08]the same piece of advice I gave to Fausta
when she wanted to fusilarte you
- after your first session. - What?
Filed away. Keep going.
[07:32.62]Do nothing.
Trust me. Trust the group.
And in time...
[07:41.40]Ryan, you came.
Grab a paintbrush and find someone
you think is beautiful.
You won't have to look far.
[07:47.31]- It's not working out. - What?
You. The group.
We've hit a nice stride since I joined.
You don't fit.
[07:53.64]Did you read the poem I sent you?
No, I didn't read the stupid poem
you sent me by "yee-ahts."
I realize it's pronounced yeats,
[07:59.65]but I'm mispronouncing it to take away its power.
You're overreacting. There's room for both of us.
You are wrong.
[08:06.29]Everybody, a word.
Ryan, we find beauty.
I draw Owen. He's naked.
[08:12.86]Doesn't need to be. Is.
Painting time's over. She's gotta go.
No, no, no. Ryan, this is Simone.
[08:19.34]Yolanda is the one who we don't want.
Okay, that is not helping.
Nor did it help when you turned
[08:25.68]my friend's car upside-down.
That is not appropriate human behavior.
Okay.
[08:31.28]Can we just say what is appropriate human behavior?
Why all the drama? We like Simone.
[08:37.42]All right. I didn't want to have to do this.
But you're gonna have to choose.
Her or me, okay?
And I think you will all choose me.
[08:43.63]Except for a certain Buxom someone
who I heard has already tried to have me eliminated.
[Gasps] He knows.
[08:50.94]So what's it gonna be?
Her or me?
- Hey, Lauren. - Oh!
[08:56.94]Remember that thing I said I wasn't gonna do?
It didn't go well. Is that Owen?
Oh, yeah.
Fausta gave it to me as a consolation prize.
[09:03.98]- Doesn't make it better. - No, it makes it worse.
McBrian, your wife is asking for
[09:11.00]to follow her in the divorce.
House, my car.
My military pension.
Seems like I might be getting rooked here.
[09:18.68]You're my lawyer. What do you think?
[Sighs] I think we gotta take it.
It's why I pay you the big bucks.
[09:24.26]Danny, put down the pen!
Back off, you Porsche-driving,
coldwater canyon mansion-living,
Harvard name-dropping mother [Bleep]!
[09:32.20]He has a new lawyer.
- You're gonna help me? - Yeah.
You're so sweet.
Well... you can't let him think that.
[09:38.30]Now I have to...
[Clattering]
[Inhales deeply]
Balance restored.
[09:46.31]Thanks for joining us.
Our topic today is team chemistry
and how it can easily be undermined.
[09:52.05]Our guest, Terrell Owens.
Terrell, so when you were with the Cowboys...
I thought you brought me here to apologize
for throwing fruit at me the last time.
Right. Sorry about that fruit thing.
[10:00.03]So when you were with the Cowboys,
they were a Super Bowl contender, but...
That apology didn't feel genuine.
I'm a person, Ryan.
Not a robot in, like, those Schwarzenegger movies
[10:07.50]you always talk about.
Okay, well, we're gonna go
to the phones.
We've got John from Reseda.
[10:13.21]Ryan, it's Simone.
I feel your impression of me is way off base.
Been there, Simone.
I think you should give me a chance, Ryan.
[10:21.08]I spread awesomeness. Let's go out one night.
We are not doing this right now.
Oh, she's under your skin?
[10:27.15]She sounds attractive. Is she attractive?
You know what? We gonna go to a commercial,
and we're gonna figure this out off the air.
Thank you.
[10:33.36]All right, Terrell. We're done.
You need help.
What the...
[10:40.37]Did you paint a picture of me, man?
Hi.
[10:46.04]You stay away from me.
- Look, you know me. - No, I don't know.
And you know I have a hard time
saying I'm... W-rong.
[10:53.05]It's easy for me to accept blame.
I just have a cognitive problem
with my silent "W" s.
It's weird, I don't have any trouble
[10:59.32]w-riting them.
I need to make amends.
I have brought you this rare African grey parrot.
[11:07.06]That's a pigeon. [Pigeon coos]
I don't want your bird.
But I have to make things right.
I slapped you, I flipped your car,
[11:14.57]I poured super glue all over
your girlfriend's computer keyboard.
Girlfriend?
- Who did this? - Stop.
[11:21.27]Mr. K, I'm not even mad at you.
I'm actually mad at Ryan.
I kill myself for the guy,
and he complains about me behind my back.
[11:28.08]He doesn't understand the pressure I face
from ad sales, from audience erosion...
You know, forget it.
I don't want to bore you with the minutia
of the radio business.
[11:34.99]No, no, no.
I love minutia. Explain it all to me.
- Seriously? - May I take notes?
[11:41.19]No. You don't have to do that.
Carrie, take this down.
[Laughter]
[11:50.17]Danny, I asked you to make
a list of everything you wanted, and this is
what you've come up with? Yeah.
The pullout sofa, the wheelbarrow,
[11:58.51]the History Channel.
Just the History Channel?
Sorry.
I just got off the phone with John Lithgow.
[12:04.88]Harvard '67.
So...
Ready to sign off on my client's demands?
[12:10.02]This is what's gonna happen.
My client will pay no alimony,
he'll retain his pension
and acquire half of the joint assets.
[12:16.03]If you want to take this before a judge,
I will you eat you for lunch.
You're not a divorce attorney.
This is my specialty.
[12:23.44]Oh, yeah?
Well, my specialty is winning.
And I can and will do everything in my power
[12:30.34]to get that jury on my side.
Yeah, I can rile them up
over the injustice that's been done.
Or I can make 'em laugh.
[12:37.85]Or I can make 'em cry
over the betrayal
of a 1/64th Chinook Indian.
[12:47.13]We stole his people's land.
She stole his family...
[Crying] His dignity...
[12:54.20]His heart.
[13:02.17]Have your client sign these papers now,
or I do this for real.
[Chuckles]
Call John Lithgow. Tell him you're [Bleep].
[13:10.75]I know what you're thinking.
What awesomeness can Simone bring me here?
Just you wait.
[13:16.92]Another round of drinks, please, Charlene.
Ah, yes, the old clocking of the name tag trick.
[13:22.90]My mom does that. Nobody wants it.
What if our connection to Charlene
could change our lives?
There are no strangers...
[13:28.43]Only friends we haven't met yet.
Um... yuck.
Let's deepen our connection. Truth or dare?
[13:35.37]You realize we're not 14 years old, right?
- Truth or dare, dummy. - Fine, truth.
Where'd you meet your wife?
[13:41.38]My first radio job.
She was the daughter of the station manager,
[13:47.95]and he hated me, and I asked Janie out.
And, I think just to spite him, she said "yes."
[13:53.53]I think that's why she married me.
That and the fact that I have a six-pack.
But in order to see it, I have to breathe
all the air out of my body,
[13:59.70]and then cough, like, really hard.
- Truth or dare? - Dare.
Okay. You know Charlene's name.
[14:07.04]Now get her phone number.
Wow, Ryan, that's the first dare
I've ever heard that doesn't involve me
taking my clothes off.
Well, in fairness to me,
I didn't realize that was an option.
[14:14.45]Charlene, we've had a great time,
and I don't want it to end.
Why don't you give me your number?
You won't be sorry. I know how to do stuff.
[14:23.82][Scoffs]
I know how to do stuff too, Charlene.
[14:29.13]All right, that was good. Nicely done.
Not surprised you picked "dare" though.
You don't seem to be that big a fan of truth.
Fine, you want a free truth?
[14:35.47]Okay. Let's talk about your fiance.
The love of your life.
When's his birthday? What's his favorite color?
[14:41.47]Is he outraged that the Monkees
are not in the rock and roll hall of fame?
I don't know any of those things.
I only knew him for 24 hours.
[14:47.98]Aha! Tepid tragedy.
Does that mean that he wasn't the love of my life?
How long did it take for you
[14:54.15]to fall for the love of your life?
Not long.
Ow.
[15:00.63]There's a storm coming.
I can always feel it in my dance leg.
Really? You calling your shot
with a storm in L.A.? Leg never lies.
[15:08.87]Lady, you are either the most interesting person
I've ever met or a pathological liar.
[15:14.87]I'll take truth.
What about me makes you so crazy?
- You really want to know? - Mm-hmm.
[15:23.32]Okay, the person that I was
closest to in the world died.
And I try to keep it all cool and together,
[15:31.02]but most mornings, it's a miracle
I can even get out of bed.
And that group really helps me.
[15:38.26]I don't know how. I don't know why.
But I don't want you messing with that.
[15:46.37]Come with me.
The viewable impressions plus the roi should equal
[15:54.21]advertising effectiveness.
But in a world of time-shifted content,
the older rules no longer apply.
[16:00.55]You are w-restling with historic challenges.
[Laughs] You get it!
You're the first person that's ever
[16:07.23]taken the time to understand.
Thanks, buddy.
Are we buddies?
- Can I call you buddy? - Yeah, sure.
[16:14.13]Oh, buddy.
This is the best moment of my life, buddy.
Huh? What now?
Should we go pull a prank on some lesser pair of buddies?
[16:22.64]I would like to teach Ryan
a lesson about taking me for granted.
- Hey. - Hey.
Are we talking about teaching Ryan a lesson?
[16:29.72]- Yeah. - I'm in.
Anne is a miracle worker.
I basically get everything.
[16:36.11]So you're gonna be single. That's exciting.
Hey.
Maybe you could be my wingman.
[16:42.19]Let me check something.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You wouldn't be too much competition.
[16:48.03]All I have to do is sign here, and it is official.
Put down that pen, Danny. We're gonna get more.
More?
The jewelry that you gave her,
[16:54.31]those savings bonds from her grandparents.
The diaphragm that she got using your health coverage.
I don't want a diaphragm.
[17:00.31]Well, sell it. Use it for a yarmulke.
We're getting it.
Don't you want her to suffer for what she did to you?
No, I just want to move on.
[17:07.19]Danny, the woman made a vow.
She promised to be there through good times and bad,
by your side, forever.
[17:13.89]She doesn't get to leave because she gets bored,
or she finds someone new,
or she forgets to take her damn heart medication!
[17:26.00]You know, Anne,
it seems like you could start talking about one woman,
but end up talking about... Yeah, we're already there.
[17:33.38]This all feels very the wire.
Are we about to get "got"? We don't get got.
I take you to a meet so you get got or I get got,
[17:39.62]but we don't both get got, 'cause it's not how it works.
Yeah, I don't actually watch the show.
I know I'm supposed to.
You asked me why I took you here.
[17:50.16]I sent you a poem that would be perfect for this
if you weren't such a dude.
The world is full of magical things,
[17:57.34]patiently waiting for our senses...
Both: To grow sharper.
[18:03.44]- You did read it. - Yeah.
[Thunderclap]
[18:11.08]I told you.
Still think I'm full of it?
[18:18.86]I'm not certain I care.
[18:41.31]And it's pretty clear
you still have a lot of anger towards Patty.
Of course I do.
If she really loved me,
[18:47.85]she would have taken care of herself.
You ought to cut her some slack.
I got six grandchildren I love.
[18:54.73]But I still do things that are bad for me.
Hell, I'd drop "e" if somebody would hook me up.
[19:00.90]It's not happening, George.
I can't even sleep in our bed
because it reminds me how every night I would say,
[19:06.21]"did you take your pill?"
She would kiss me, lie to my face,
and say, "yes."
You have to let that anger go.
[19:13.31][Exhales]
You know what allows me not to hate Bonnie?
Blunt force trauma to your prefrontal cortex
suffered during basic training?
[19:19.45]No. That just left me with a few minor spatial issues.
With Bonnie, when something she's done wrong
[19:25.06]pops into my head,
I immediately think of all the good times
we had together.
Do you think you can try sleeping
[19:31.76]in your own bed tonight?
I don't know if I'm ready.
[19:39.10]Here. It's right here.
You know, you said you would be here for me.
I didn't think you were being literal.
[19:46.81]This group does not do well with metaphors.
Plus, we made you
a first-night-in-your-bed cake.
[19:52.68]This cake is delicious, Fausta.
My secret:
I use an extra cup of Brown sugar
and breast milk.
[19:59.69]Okay, you know what?
I've changed my mind.
I don't think I can do this tonight.
Wait. You can do it, Anne.
[20:05.66]Think about the good times.
You're right.
[20:11.34]Thank you, guys.
I can do it, I can... Aah!
[20:18.74][Screaming]
Oh, no! Straight sex!
This is a very big step for me.
[20:24.25]Why here?

[20:30.39]Please.
