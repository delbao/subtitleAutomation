梅芙失踪了  我觉得是被跟踪狂抓住了

See, it's not about the message.

35
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,780
而是颜料  他在她脸上画的颜料
It's about the medium. What he used to draw on her face.

36
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,930
这是黑色眼线液
It's black eyeliner.

37
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,750

从她衣柜里拿的
From her closet.

42
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,920
就在我打伤她的头之后
Right after I bashed her head in.

43
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,030
站上去
Get on the ledge.

44
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,670
如果你想杀了我  就动手吧

是
Yes.

51
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,880

你在哪  我邀你晚上一起来跳舞的时候
Where are you? When I said let's go out dancing tonight,

54
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,110
可没想让你把我一个人扔在这里
I didn't expect it to involve you leaving me alone

55
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,030
自己去勾搭兄弟会的人
while you scam on some frat guy.

56
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,060
十分钟内给我回电话  不然我就走了

工作怎么样
How was work?

60
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,230
狗屁工作  小费太少了
It sucked. Tips were horrible.

61
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,730
我觉得应该在上班路上来看看斯宾塞
Thought I'd check on Spence on my way into work.

62
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,530
对  我也是
Yeah. Me, too.

63
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,200
都是你准备的吗
Are these all from you?

64
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,020
是啊
Maybe.

65
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,910
那个里面是什么
What's in that one?

66
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,770
有坚果和种子
Mixed nuts and seeds.

67
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,590
我一直在想有什么东西能让他感觉好一些
I'm trying to think of something that will help him feel better.

68
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,010
于是我就像里德那样  做了一大堆研究
So I went Reid-like and I did a bunch of research

69
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,210
最后查到  坚果和种子
and it turns out that nuts and seeds

70
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,030
具有天然的镁元素
have naturally occurring magnesium,

71
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,780
镁元素能促进产生血清素
and magnesium influences the production of serotonin,

72
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,700
而血清素会使大脑产生非常非常欢快的感觉
which is a happy happy joy joy chemical in the brain.

73
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,680
不知道真的假的
I don't know.

74
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,860
斯宾塞  听着  你在屋里吧
Spence, listen, if you're in there,

75
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,640
我们只是想知道你没事
we just want to know that you're all right.

76
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,050
如果你还清醒的话  敲两下门
Knock twice if you're conscious.

77
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,470
他还能恢复正常吗
Is he ever gonna be ok?

78
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,590
早晚会的
Eventually.

79
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,850
他也知道  不管如何
And he knows we're all here for him,

80
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,050
他还有我们
no matter what.

81
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,630
她说的没错
Yeah. What she said.

82
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,930
走吧
Come on.

83
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,010

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,500
听着  孩子  回头给我个电话

90
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,090

我不好
Well, no.

96
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,070
有时我在想
Sometimes I wonder if I hadn't

97
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,050
如果我不催他和梅芙见面的话
pushed him so hard to meet maeve...

98
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,180
布莱克  你不能责备自己鼓励他
Blake, you can't blame yourself for encouraging him.

99
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,690
我知道  我知道
I know. I know.

100
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,650
有些事不管怎样都会发生的
It was bound to happen no matter what.

101
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,040
我真想念里德
I miss Reid.

102
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,390
他告诉你要休息多久吗
Did he tell you how long?

103
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,540
没有  我跟他说需要歇多久就歇多久
No. I told him to take as much time as he needed.

104
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,670
至少我还有个机会和卡洛琳说再见
At least I got a chance to say good-bye to Carolyn.

105
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,080
我真不敢想象

108
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,490

109
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,900

00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,070
电缆车站附近被发现
in San Francisco's Mission District.

112
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,570
他们的尸体都用透明塑料包住了
They were both found wrapped in clear plastic.

113
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,390
资料显示他们死于被发现几小时
It says here they were dead only a few hours before they were found.

114
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,590
时间这么短  化学元素
That's not long enough for the elements

115
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,140
不可能让尸体变这么白
to have made them that pale.

116
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,720
因为我们马上就要进入
'Cause that's where we enter

117
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,970
诡异镇  恶心巷了
the town of weirdville on the corner of eew and icky-icky.

118
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,390
两名死者的血液几乎都被抽光了
Both victims were almost completely drained of their blood.

119
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,770
只剩下不到一品脱[约551毫升]
Less than a pint left.

120
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,250
凶手抽了他们的血
He's exsanguinating them.

121
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,810
是趁他们还活着的时候
While they were still alive.

122
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,250
这样可能方便些
It might be utilitarian.

123
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,810
他不着急杀他们  好让血液自行泵出来
He needs them alive so they can pump out the blood themselves.

124
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,730
把人体内的血抽得那么彻底  这很难做到
Draining a body like that is extremely hard to do.

125
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,140
一旦心脏停止跳动
Once the heart stops pumping,

126
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,960
想再抽血就很难了
it's difficult to continue to extract the blood.

127
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,990
所以问题就是  他是怎么做的
So the question is, how is he doing it?

128
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,050
我真希望你没问这个问题
Oh, I wish you wouldn't have asked that

129
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,790
因为我要给你们看这些图片了
'cause now I gotta show this picture.

130
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,380
两名死者的股动脉处都有很大的孔
There are large bore holes in the femoral artery of each victim.

131
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,520
看来我们的不明嫌犯还挺懂医
Our unsub could have medical knowledge.

132
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:40,980
很有可能
It's possible.

133
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,030
我们去现场搜集更多信息
We'll know more when we get there.

134
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,260
30分钟后起飞
Wheels up in 30.

135
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,240
我只剩下鲜血  尽管拿去
"My blood alone remains. Take it.

136
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,310
但别让我受罪太久
But do not make me suffer long."

137
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,060
玛丽・安托瓦内特
Marie antoinette.

138
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,060
[早年为奥地利女大公  后为法国王后]

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
为什么选这两个人
Why these two victims?

140
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,500
他们的社会地位  种族和性别均不同
He's crossed socioeconomic, race, and gender lines.

141
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,140
40多岁的白人男性
One white males in his 40s,

142
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,960
一个富有的对冲基金经理
a wealthy hedge fund manager.

143
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,570
和一名黑人女性
And an African American female,

144
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,670
刚进入旧金山州立大学
just started college at San Francisco State,

145
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,890
身兼数职以维持生计
worked several jobs just to get by.

146
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,300
为什么要抽血呢
Yeah, but why drain the blood?

147
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,200
他是在折磨死者吗
Is he doing it to torture the victims?

148
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,450
还是单纯的为了血
Or is it about the blood?

149
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,390
可能是种心理上的折磨
Might be a form of psychological torture.

150
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,380
虽然被害人可能不怎么痛苦
While not necessarily painful,

151
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,750
但抽血确实需要时间
exsanguination does take time.

152
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,370
可能是迷恋血液或者抽血
It could be a fetish for the blood and the bloodletting.

153
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,230
说不定
What about...

154
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,610
是饮血
drinking it?

155
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,240
弗里兹・哈曼  汉诺威吸血鬼
Fritz Haarmann, the vampire of Hanover,

156
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,950
他杀死的人大多喉咙直接被咬开
killed many of his victims by biting through their throats.

157
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,960
这个不明嫌犯用管子之类的设备
This unsub used some sort of tubing device

158
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,410
从股动脉抽血
to drain the blood from the femoral arteries.

159
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,440
伤口处没有唾液
There isn't any saliva on the wound.

160
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,070
没有被咬的痕迹
Just because there's no bite marks

161
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,230
不代表能排除吸血鬼式作案
doesn't mean we should rule out vampirism.

162
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,310
坏消息  罪案斗士们
Bad news, crime-fighters.

163
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,700
警察又在公园长椅上发现了一具
Police just found another body wrapped in plastic

164
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,290
用塑料包起来的尸体  血也被抽干了
on a park bench, drained of blood.

165
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,620
我想附近应该没有两个变态
I'm gonna assume there's not two creeps

166
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,000
干着一样的事吧
in the area doing the same thing?

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,430
加西亚  请你通知旧金山警局
Garcia, will you tell San Francisco P.D.

168
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,910
我们马上去犯罪现场
we'll meet them at the crime scene?

169
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,020
没问题
Consider them told.

170
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,130
戴夫  你和布莱克去犯罪现场见警探
Dave, you and Blake meet the detectives at the crime scene.

171
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,810
摩根  你去法医那看看
Morgan, go see the medical examiner,

172
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,110
小洁和我在警局行动
and JJ and I will set up at the police station.

173
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,190
我们去跟死者家属谈谈
We'll talk to the families,

174
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,580
看能否找到两人之间的联系
see if we can find a connection.

175
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,520
警探
Detective.

176
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,750
我是特别督察探员罗西
SSA Rossi.

177
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,330
这位是特别督察探员布莱克
This is SSA Blake.

178
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,740
我是莱尼・迈尔斯警探
Detective Lenny Miles.

179
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,770
你们能来真是太好了
It's great to have you guys here.

180
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,770
死者名叫林恩・斯蒂文斯
So the victim's name is Lynn Stevens.

181
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,570
她也像前两名死者一样  被抽干了血
She's drained, just like the last two,

182
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,720
但她身上有点新花样
but there's something new.

183
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,660
新花样
New?

184
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,510
他把她眼睑割了
He's removed her eyelids.

185
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,810
我都不想猜
I don't even want to take a guess

186
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,540
为什么会有人这么做
as to why someone would do that.

187
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,340
眼部周围有大量血液
There's excessive blood around the eyes.

188
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,010
他是在她死之前割的
He did this antemortem.

189
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,820
他的虐待兴致开始升级了
His sadism is evolving.

190
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,710
他的折磨这次肯定
And his torture is definitely

191
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,470
不止是心理上的了
more than psychological at this point.

192
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,300
我真不明白怎么会有人做出这种事
I just don't understand why someone would do this.

193
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,800
还是很难以置信
It's all still so hard to believe.

194
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,880
我就问几个关于你丈夫的问题
I just need to ask you a few questions about your husband.

195
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,740
帕米是个好女孩
Pammy was a great girl. You know?

196
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,800
真的很友善
Really friendly.

197
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,420
她和大家都处得很好
She loved everyone, and everyone loved her.

198
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,690
她被人绑架那晚
And you two had worked together

199
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,380
你俩在一起工作吗
the night that she was abducted?

200
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,440
他给我打过电话
He called me.

201
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,260
他说他在下班回家的路上了
He said he was on his way home from work.

202
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,320
只要中途去完成一笔交易就行
He just needed to stop off and close up a deal.

203
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,060
他行程里写着那晚没事
He didn't have anything in his schedule for that night.

204
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,580
你知道是什么交易吗
Do you have any idea what that deal was?

205
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,310
下班后  她说一直很喜欢长距离散步
After work, she said she always liked to go on long walks.

206
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,270
她一直喋喋不休说这里的建筑风格
She was always going on about the architecture,

207
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,940
跟俄勒冈州完全不同
how it's nothing like Oregon.

208
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,810
她刚搬来旧金山吗
She had just moved to San Francisco?

209
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,430
你还知道她有什么朋友
Are there any other friends of hers that you know

210
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,840
我们需要找来问话的吗
who we should talk to?

211
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,410
她半工半读
She was paying her way through school.

212
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,970
不在这里  就是在打另一份工
When she wasn't there, she was always at another job.

213
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,120
勉强生存而已
Just trying to stay afloat. You know?

214
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,500
如果你还想起什么
If you think of anything else,

215
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,460
请马上来电
please, don't hesitate to call.

216
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,800
我没看出这些死者之间有联系
If these victims are connected, I can't see it.

217
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,580
关键一定是血
It's got to be about the blood.

218
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,710
血型也不同啊
Yeah, but even that's different.

219
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,070
加里是A+型  帕米是O-型
Gary was A-Positive, Pam was O-Neg.

220
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,810
最新死者
We just got the lab report

221
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,260
林恩・斯蒂文斯的实验室报告来了
back on the latest victim, Lynn Stevens.

222
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,890
她是AB-型
She was AB-Negative.

223
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,000
也许嫌犯是随机选择死者
Maybe these are just victims of opportunity.

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,830
不明嫌犯可能在
Well, it's possible the unsub

225
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,360
帕梅拉例行散步时绑架了她
abducted Pamela on one of her routine walks.

226
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,270
他可能用
He could have lured Gary

227
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,470
一笔有利可图的金钱交易引诱了加里
with the promise of a lucrative money deal.

228
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,070
我是艾米
Hi. I'm Aimee.

229
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,290
这地方不错
Nice place.

230
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,750
75块一小时
Ok, so it's going to be 75 for the hour.

231
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,780
超过一小时再议
Anything more than that we can discuss.

232
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,530
行吗
All right?

233
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,790
有地方让我换衣服吗
Someplace where I can get changed?

234
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,470
那边
There.

235
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,920
我不知道你喜欢什么体位
I don't know which positions you want me in,

236
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,510
不过我很全能
but I'm very flexible.

237
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,430
怎么了  小宝贝
What's up, baby girl?

238
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,280
我很担心里德
I'm worried about Reid.

239
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,250
我也是
I am, too.

240
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,910
你觉得他怎么样了
What do you think he's doing?

241
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,870
我觉得他在用霍奇给他的时间慢慢疗伤
I think he's taking the time that Hotch gave him.

242
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,540
我明白  他很难过  他应该难过的
I get it. He's sad. He should be sad.

243
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,470
但我很担心
But I'm so worried.

244
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,060
我爱的人受伤时
And when someone I love is hurting,

245
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,220
我也会跟着受伤  我太依赖别人了
it's like I hurt, too, which I know is super codependent,

246
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,180
但我就是这样的
but it's just how I roll,

247
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,670
我觉得自己应该做点什么
and I feel like I should be doing something,

248
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,800
虽说我不知道我能做什么
and I don't know what it is, but--

249
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,840
好了  慢慢说好吗  慢慢说
All right, slow down, all right? Just slow down.

250
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,940
你能给他打电话吗
Could you call him?

251
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,100
我打过了  但他现在还没准备好跟人交谈
I have. He's just not ready to talk to anybody right now.

252
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,870
我得听听他的声音  不然我没法工作
I need to hear his voice. It's impairing my ability to work.

253
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,450
我试试吧
Let me try something, all right?

254
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,480
谢谢
Thanks.

255
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,970
你好  我是斯宾塞・里德  请留言

Hey, Reid, it's Derek. Listen, I got a work question for you.

257
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,170
不明嫌犯放光了死者的血
The unsub's exsanguinating victims

258
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,970
还在他们临死前割掉了他们的眼睑
and removing their eyelids antemortem.

259
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,980
你有什么头绪吗  给我回电
Does that mean anything to you? Hit me back.

260
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,540
这是你要的信息
Here's the information you called about.

261
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,780
谢谢
Thank you.

262
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,780
失陪一下
Excuse me for a second.

263
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,230
怎么样  里德
What's up, Reid?

264
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,050
死者角膜和瞳孔有任何损伤吗
Have the cornea or pupils been harmed in any way?

265
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,490
没有  布莱克说看起来
No, no. Blake said it looked like

266
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,510
嫌犯用的是非常锋利的器械
a very sharp instrument was used.

267
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,750
要是他特别注意不损伤眼睛
If he's taking care not to damage the eyes,

268
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,880
那视线可能对他很重要
then line of sight is probably what's important to him.

269
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,170
这人希望死者看到他所做的事
So this guy wants them to see what he's doing.

270
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,550
里德  你怎么样
Hey, Reid. How are you?

271
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,080
我要挂了
I gotta go.

272
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,240
很抱歉
Sorry about that.

273
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,340
没关系
Not a problem.

274
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,430
死因肯定是失血致死
Cause of death would definitely be exsanguination.

275
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,270
不过毒性检测显示出极高含量的
But the tox screen showed high levels of--

276
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,140
以五倍的速度说一遍  乙二胺四乙酸
say this 5 times fast-- ethylene diamine tetra acetic.

277
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,990
EDTA  是一种阻凝剂
EDTA. It's an anti-coagulant.

278
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,980
多用于治疗心脏问题
Used mostly to treat heart conditions.

279
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,360
不明嫌犯可能是用它稀释血液
So the unsub probably used it to thin the blood.

280
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,310
我们发现的氯胺酮可能也起了同样的作用
The ketamine we found may have helped as well.

281
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,540
用在人身上会使血压升高
In humans, it tends to elevate blood pressure.

282
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,290
他就是借此让被害人昏迷的
Which is how he's sedating them.

283
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,730
如果他给被害人下药后
If he knew that he was giving these drugs to these victims

284
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,830
还把血喝了呢
and he ingested the blood?

285
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,380
就和给自己下药无异
He'd be dosing himself as well.

286
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,180
那就不是吸食人血了
Well, that rules out vampirism.

287
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,330
嫌犯可能在医学领域工作吗
Is there any chance this guy works in the medical field?

288
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,200
我看不像  伤口周围有一些试探伤
I doubt it. There are a few hesitation marks near the wound,

289
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,840
动脉的伤口周围有大面积瘀伤
and the hole in the artery shows a lot of bruising around it.

290
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,590
最多是个实习生
I'd say it's amateur at best.

291
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,660
好吧  这名嫌犯
All right, so we got an unsub

292
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,410
随机选择其被害人
who's picking his victims at random,

293
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,780
迷晕他们  再抽干他们的血
sedates them, then bleeds them dry.

294
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,020
如果不是把血喝了的话
If he's not drinking the blood,

295
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,570
他到底用血来做什么呢
what the hell is he doing with it?

296
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,210
等等
Wait...

297
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,130
等等
Wait...

298
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,600
别动
Shh, shh, shh. Be still.

299
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,750
你在做什么
What's--what-- what are you doing?

300
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,940
住手  住手
Wait--wait--aah!

301
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,420
我们查到了指纹
Well, we got a hit off the prints.

302
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,400
被害人名叫艾米・福特纳
The victim's name is Aimee Fortner.

303
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,280
距离他上次杀人仅过了一天
It's only been a day since his last kill.

304
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,680
这人都没有冷静周期
Well, this guy doesn't have a cool-down period.

305
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,110
尸体还没有僵硬
Rigor hasn't set in yet.

306
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,390
放在这应该也就一个小时
I'd say she was put here maybe an hour ago,

307
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,990
日出时分
just after sunrise.

308
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,250
他越来越肆无忌惮了
He's getting brazen.

309
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,170
这是他第一次白天弃尸
It's his first daytime disposal.

310
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,670
公园的这部分一般没人经过
Well, this part of the park's not very well traveled.

311
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,470
市政府一直想隔几年就整修一次
The city's been trying to renovate every couple of years,

312
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,530
不过你懂的  政治嘛
but you know--politics.

313
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,600
不明嫌犯对此地十分熟悉
So the unsub is familiar enough with the area

314
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,650
知道不会有人打扰他
to know nobody would disturb him.

315
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,070
万事屋  有什么需要效劳的
Office of omnipotence. How may I dazzle you?

316
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,360
加西亚  我需要最新被害人艾米・福特纳的信息
Garcia, I need information on the latest victim, Aimee Fortner.

317
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,270
提供信息是我最在行的  长官
Information is my favorite way to dazzle, sir.

318
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,050
包您满意
So sparkly.

319
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,640
有了 艾米・克里斯多・福特纳
Here we go Aimee Crystal Fortner.

320
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,630
来自圣克拉拉市
Originally from Santa Clara.

321
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,420
很漂亮
She was super pretty.

322
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,240
不做酒巴服务员后
When she wasn't bartending,

323
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,470
靠做模特维持生计
she supplemented her income by modeling.

324
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,690
模特
A model?

325
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,970
没错  她有个网站
Yes. And she's got a website

326
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,520
上面都是她的艺术照
full of very artistic pictures of herself.

327
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,220
这姑娘相当乐于炫耀她那天赐的身材
Girl was not afraid to flaunt what god gave her at all.

328
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,680
谢谢  加西亚
Uh-huh. Thanks, Garcia.

329
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,180
你在想什么
What are you thinking?

330
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,550
里德告诉摩根被害人的视线
Reid told Morgan line of sight

331
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,920
对于不明嫌犯很重要
was important to the unsub.

332
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,620
我们该去看看其他犯罪现场
We should take a look at the other crime scenes.

333
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,780
我可能知道他用血做什么了
I might know what he's doing with the blood.

334
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,270
我们认为不明嫌犯是名白人男性
We believe that this unsub is a white male

335
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,430
20或30多岁
in his 20s or 30s,

336
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,630
他自认为是名画家或艺术家
and he thinks of himself as a painter or an artist.

337
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,590
弃尸地点透露了许多嫌犯的信息
The placement of the victims tells us a lot about who he is.

338
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,820
帕梅拉・赫德被发现的周围有一幅
Pamela hurd was found near a painting done by

339
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,620
鲜为人知的旧金山艺术家亨利・弗洛伊德的画作
little known San Francisco artist Henry Floyd.

340
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,950
加里・波特被放置于一幅街头涂鸦旁
Gary Porter was posed near a piece of graffiti art

341
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,550
作者是街头艺术家赛弗
by a street artist named Cypher,

342
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,990
目前此人正被警方通缉
who is currently wanted by the police.

343
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,510
第三名被害人  林恩・斯蒂文斯附近有幅壁画
And the third victim, Lynn Stevens, was found near a mural

344
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,180
是贫民区的青少年画的
painted by inner city youths.

345
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,180
最后  艾米・福特纳被弃尸在圣路加雕像旁
Finally, Aimee Fortner was placed near the statue of Saint Luke,

346
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,160
艺术家的保护神
patron saint of the artist.

347
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,650
这是起内心冲动引发的犯罪  并非偶然
This is a compulsion. It's not accidental.

348
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,280
他沉迷于艺术
He is obsessed with art.

349
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,780
那些艺术作品都被无视  忽略  抛弃了
All of the works of art are neglected, ignored, cast aside.

350
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,740
他认为自己也是如此
It's how he feels about himself.

351
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,230
我们相信这也是他
We believe it's also the reason that he's evolved in

352
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,070
切除被害人眼睑的原因
removing the victims' eyelids.

353
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,570
强迫他们看他所看
He's forcing them to see what he sees.

354
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,330
这些谋杀与性欲无关
There's no sexual component with these murders,

355
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,240
因为血液本身及其用途就是他
but that's because the blood and the use of the blood

356
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,100
释放性欲的方式
is his sexual release.

357
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,740
等等
So, wait.

358
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,020
他用那些血做了什么
What--what is he doing with the blood?

359
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,650
他太沉溺于艺术
Because he's so obsessed with art,

360
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,300
我们认为他用血液作画
we believe he's painting with it.

361
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,250
他频频杀人
He has a quick kill pace.

362
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,250
更多的血液意味着更多的画作
More blood means more paint.

363
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,900
而他作的画越多
The more paintings he does,

364
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,970
有人认出他的作品的概率就越大
the greater the chance someone will recognize his work.

365
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,170
我们认为  为了得到认同
We think that because of his need for acceptance,

366
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,050
他可能会试着卖出自己的作品
he may be trying to sell the paintings.

367
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,810
所以请密切关注可能出售
So focus your canvassing on places

368
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,240
这种边缘作品的地方
that might sell this kind of fringe art.

369
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,050
怎么了  小鬼
What's up, kid?

370
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,270
如果事关艺术
If it is about the art,

371
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,000
那么很明显抛尸地点分散在
then it's clear the disposal sites are scattered

372
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,440
教会区周围
around the Mission District area.

373
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,570
等等  你怎么知道
Wait a minute. How did you know--

374
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,540
我让安德森带了些卷宗给我
I had Anderson bring over some of the files.

375
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,550
好  好  等一下  我把加西亚接进来
All right. All right, hold on a second. Let me patch in Garcia.

376
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,450
他说了什么  他还好吗
What have you heard? Is he ok?

377
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,300
别急  别急
Slow down. Slow down.

378
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,140
里德
Reid.

379
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,970
加西亚  你应该列出
Garcia, you should pull a list

380
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,210
旧金山所有的画廊
of all the art galleries in San Francisco.

381
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,070
里德  我刚刚
Reid, I was just--

382
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,910
你怎么样
How are you?

383
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,230
好些了
Better.

384
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,500
多谢关心
Thanks for asking.

385
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,900
另外谢谢你的坚果篮
And thanks for the baskets.

386
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,620
坚果富含镁元素  可以促进分泌
You know, nuts have magnesium, which helps produce--

387
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,250
血清素  我知道
Serotonin. Yeah. I know.

388
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,320
好了  画廊  我搜到了很多
Ok, galleries. I got a lot.

389
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,840
注意教会区的画廊
Focus on the Mission District.

390
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,850
好歹开口了
I guess that's better than nothing.

391
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,300
对  我也这么想
It is. I will take it.

392
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,990
还是有好些画廊  不过查起来容易多了
Ok, there's still a few galleries, but it's more manageable.

393
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,190
我把地址发到你手机上了
I am sending the addresses to your mobile.

394
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,860
收到了  谢了  加西亚
I got it. Thanks, Garcia.

395
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,820
不客气
Yeah.

396
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,850
这是赫尔曼的原作
It's an original Hellman.

397
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,520
他在临终前画下这幅作品
He painted it while literally on his deathbed.

398
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,830
10000
10,000.

399
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,360
-麦迪森  -什么
- Madison. - Yeah?

400
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
他又来了
He's back.

401
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,710
博物馆已经准备好出价了
The museum is ready to make me an offer.

402
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,760
很好
Perfect.

403
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,860
如果你愿意的话  我可以让他离开
If you want, I can tell him to leave.

404
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,040
不用了  没事
No, it's ok.

405
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,640
赖利女士
Mrs. Riley.

406
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,820
我想这次你会对我的作品更满意的
I think you'll be much more pleased with my piece this time.

407
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,250
我已经说过了
Yeah, um, like I told you the last time,

408
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,790
我没兴趣
I'm not interested.

409
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,210
为什么呢
Why not?

410
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,090
因为这不是我们
Well, because this type of art

411
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,650
想要的艺术风格
is just not what we're looking for.

412
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,960
那你们想要什么样的呢
Well, what is it you are looking for?

413
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,350
看得出来你有所进步
Look, I can see that you're getting better.

414
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,070
我能说的是  这幅画有点简略过头了
All I can tell you is it's a little simplistic.

415
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,890
所有伟大的艺术家都会
Look, every good artist leaves

416
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,970
在某种程度上将自己融入画作
a piece of himself on the canvas.

417
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,230
你得找出
You have to find that one thing

418
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,230
能让你脱颖而出的东西
that's going to set you apart from the rest of the crowd.

419
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,300
我用血画的
I used blood.

420
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,890
我指的不是特殊的材料
An unusual medium is not what I'm talking about.

421
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,630
今天的一切都毫无道理
The world today doesn't make sense.

422
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,910
我为何还要画出有意义的作品呢
Why should I paint pictures that do?

423
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,630
毕加索
Picasso.

424
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,810
真不错
I'm impressed.

425
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,480
如果我找到了自己的特色
If I find my signature,

426
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,130
你会考虑在画廊收录我的作品吗
you'll consider me for the gallery?

427
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,900
不无可能
Anything's possible.

428
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,230
我知道了
Yeah.

429
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,880
谢谢
Thank you.

430
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,000
需要我帮忙吗
Can I help you?

431
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,370
我们是联调局的
We're from the FBI.

432
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,480
你是这里的老板吗
You the owner?

433
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,450
是的  我叫特雷
Yeah. Name's Tre.

434
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,500
你有没有展出以血液为颜料的作品
Do you have any art on display where blood is used as a medium?

435
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,800
没有
No.

436
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,410
没有  但几天前有个人过来
No, but there was a guy in here a couple days ago

437
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,240
想要卖这样的作品
who tried to sell me a piece like that.

438
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,740
这不太对我的胃口
It wasn't exactly my taste,

439
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,180
不过正好有个客户在这里
but a customer of mine happened to be in here,

440
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,740
一看到就爱上了那幅画  当时就买下来了
saw it, fell in love with it, bought it on sight.

441
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,380
那会是你们要找的人吗
You think that could that be your guy?

442
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,050
你这里不会正好有监控摄像头吧
You wouldn't happen to have any security cameras in here, would you?

443
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,100
没有
No.

444
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,900
如果你找到他的名字  请告诉我们
We need the customer's name if you've got it.

445
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,990
好
Yeah.

446
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,470
我完全看不懂这些东西
I never quite understood these things.

447
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,640
感觉作者在作画时处于癫狂状态
It all looks like the guy had a seizure while painting it.

448
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,760
作者是埃米尔・哈特福德
It's Emile Hartford.

449
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,290
是20世纪初的作品
It's early 20th century.

450
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,370
他女儿八岁时夭折
His daughter died when she was 8.

451
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,800
他说每当作画时  就能看见女儿
He said every time he painted, he'd be able to see her.

452
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,730
我不知道这画上能看出什么来
Don't know how you see anything in there.

453
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,350
难怪他们说  艺术是给有缘人看的
I guess that's why they say art is in the eye of the beholder.

454
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,550
是啊
Yeah.

455
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,650
还有样东西也需要有缘人
You know what else is in the eye of the beholder?

456
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,010
记得我上周说的57年雪弗兰吗
'57 Chevy I told you about last week?

457
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,910
就在今早  砰  它寿终正寝
This morning, bam, it won't start.

458
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,430
现在修理师就是它的有缘人
Now it's in the eye of my mechanic.

459
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,360
你是要我求你呢
Come on, man, are you gonna make me ask

460
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,470
还是心甘情愿把我当朋友  送我回家
or are you gonna be a friend and offer me a ride home?

461
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,520
我们算朋友
We're friends.

462
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,910
都共事两年了  应该算吧
Worked together for two years now. I'd hope so.

463
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,530
要我开车送你吗  保罗
You need a ride, Paul?

464
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,000
我还以为你不会问呢
Thought you'd never ask.

465
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,220
嫌犯把作品卖到这个地方
The unsub sold his painting to this place?

466
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,220
这里让我想起80年代
It reminds me of the eighties.

467
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,160
干嘛
What?

468
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,070
我会感兴趣吗
Do I even want to know?

469
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,640
或许吧
Probably.

470
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,130
欢迎光临  我是安德雷
Welcome. My name is Andre.

471
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,620
首先  请你们填一份弃权单
Before we start, I'll need you to fill out a small waiver.

472
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,260
不不  我们不是一对
No, no, no. We're not a couple.

473
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,930
不管什么关系  我们都竭诚为您服务
That's ok. We cater to all kinds of relationships.

474
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,140
其实我们是联调局的
Well, uh, our relationship is with the FBI.

475
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,080
哎呀
Oh.

476
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,580
我开的店没有问题
I run a clean establishment here.

477
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,890
清白  合法  成人娱乐
Clean, legal, adult fun.

478
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,200
冷静  我们只是来找一幅你最近买的画
Calm down. We're just looking for a painting you bought recently.

479
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,280
请你们说清楚点
You're gonna have to be a bit more specific.

480
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,690
我可是黑暗堕落艺术的鉴赏行家
I'm a connoisseur of the dark and depraved arts.

481
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,580
我买的画多了去了
I purchase a lot of paintings.

482
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,810
这幅画是你在几天前买的
Well, you bought this one a couple of days ago.

483
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,300
它用鲜血作成
It's made with blood.

484
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,570
是人血
Human blood.

485
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,810
我说过  我买的画太多
Like I said, I buy a lot of paintings.

486
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,220
我都记不清了
I don't remember them all.

487
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,220
是吗  不过我记得
Oh, really? Because last I checked,

488
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,140
私藏证据会让你成为共犯
withholding evidence would make you an accomplice.

489
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,940
我们只是想看看这幅画
We just want to see the painting.

490
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,130
确认一下  它是否出自我们要找的人之手
Just want to see if it's from the guy we're looking for.

491
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,630
现在想起来了吗
Remembering now?

492
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,200
好像想起来了
Possibly.

493
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,160
要看那幅画  你们得跟我去"打屁屁"房间
For that piece, you'll have to follow me to the spanking room.

494
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,060
我买它时可没想到
I may have bought it, but I didn't realize

495
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,740
它会成为什么证据
it was evidence of any sort.

496
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,320
这就是你们找的画吗
Is that that you're looking for?

497
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,870
她那饱受折磨的眼神让我眼前一亮
The tortured look in her eyes is what first drew me to it.

498
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,770
那人要价1500
The guy was asking 1,500 for it.

499
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,150
我还价到250  现金支付
I got him to take 250, cash.

500
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,990
那是第一位被害人  帕梅拉・赫德
That's our first victim, Pamela Hurd.

501
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,420
这绝对是嫌犯画的
It's definitely from our guy.

502
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,360
我们要带走这幅画
Yeah, we're gonna need to take this.

503
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,780
你在做什么
What are you doing?

504
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,780
什么...
What...

505
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,840
什么...
What...

506
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,160
发生了什么事
What's going on?

507
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,220
怎么
What--

508
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,190
别这样  求你了
No, please don't.

509
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,230
为什么
Why?

510
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,120
我别无选择
It's the only way.

511
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,210
对不起
Sorry.

512
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,700
你疯了
You're insane.

513
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,480
艺术家不都是疯子吗
I guess every artist is a little crazy.

514
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,510
别这样  我们是朋友
No, come on man, we're friends.

515
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,870
正因如此
Exactly.

516
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,610
这就是我画中所缺失的
It's what I've been missing.

517
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,320
私人元素
Something personal.

518
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,870
你别动
I need you to hold still.

519
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,900
别动
Hold still.

520
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,470
别动
Hold still...

521
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,080
不要动
Hold still!

522
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,390
救命啊
Help!

523
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,990
不
No! Aah!

524
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,100
不
No!

525
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,900
不要
No...No!

526
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,680
现在我们有了嫌犯的作品
Well, we now have a piece of his art,

527
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,780
但依然没有能够查出他身份的线索
but we still don't have anything to identify the unsub.

528
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,420
实验室拿到样本
The lab's got a sample,

529
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,250
但那八成是帕梅拉・赫德的血
but it's probably Pamela Hurd's blood.

530
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,820
安德雷大师说他是一个普通白人
Master Andre said he was an average white guy

531
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,310
二三十岁
in his late 20s to early 30s.

532
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,790
画廊老板也这么说  他署了名
Same thing the gallery owner said. He signed it.

533
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,230
看起来像是以字母B开头或结尾的名字
Yeah, it looks like a "B" something or something "B".

534
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,810
我叫加西亚整理一份名字里
I'm going to have Garcia compile a list of artists

535
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,900
带字母B的艺术家的名单
with the letter "B" somewhere in their name.

536
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,750
虽然线索很少  但总算没一无所获
It's not much, but it's something.

537
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,660
实验室报告出来了
We got the report back from the lab.

538
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,850
从画作上无法提取DNA
They couldn't extract any DNA from the painting.

539
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,880
他们说上面的血只有红细胞
They said something about there only being red blood cells.

540
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,540
看来他提取了白细胞
Hmm. He removed the white blood cells.

541
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,070
血浆
Plasma.

542
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,820
他要血浆做什么
Why would he take the plasma?

543
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,750
增加浓度  更好作画
It would make it thicker. Easier to use as a paint.

544
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,550
要怎样的设备才能提取
What type of equipment would it take to do that?

545
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,870
只需几百美元就能网购
You can easily buy a centrifuge online these days

546
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,800
一个离心分离器
for a couple hundred bucks.

547
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,460
他从血液里提取血浆
What other reasons would he

548
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,860
还有其他可能的原因吗
have for separating the plasma from the blood?

549
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,140
是个人习惯
It's a habit.

550
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,960
-里德  -斯宾塞
- Reid. - Spence.

551
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,440
我没想到你这么快就回来了
I didn't expect you back this soon.

552
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,730
你确定准备好了吗
You sure you're ready?

553
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,760
没有  我只是对案件有些想法
No, but I think I figured something out.

554
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,160
赖利女士在哪
Where's Mrs. Riley?

555
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,020
请你离开
You need to leave.

556
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,830
不要紧  艾伦  我来处理
It's ok, Alan, I'll handle it.

557
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,350
我照你说的做了
I did what you said.

558
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,720
这是我的朋友  保罗
This is my friend, Paul.

559
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,200
我甚至用了些自己的血
I even used some of my own blood.

560
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,660
我说的不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

561
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,310
但你说过如果我加入私人元素
But you said if I made it more personal,

562
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,730
就可以为画廊所用
you'd use me in your gallery.

563
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,780
我一直对你很客气  不断地鼓励你
Look, I've been trying to be nice and give you some encouragement,

564
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,190
但我现在发现这样完全帮不了你
but I can see now that that's really not gonna help you.

565
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,460
所以我就直言不讳了
So I think I just have to be blunt.

566
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,970
你的作品不怎么样
It's not good.

567
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,820
但是...
But...

568
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,360
这幅
This is--

569
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,050
这幅是抽象派作品
This is abstract.

570
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,500
我知道抽象派的意思
I understand the concept,

571
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,690
但在画布上随便洒点颜料
but splashing something onto a canvas,

572
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,480
不能称为艺术
that doesn't make it art.

573
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,580
天赋是与生俱来的  不是每人都能拥有
Some people have it, some people don't.

574
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,790
你不知道你自己在说些什么
You don't know what you're talking about.

575
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,530
可能是  但我还是不会买下这幅画
Maybe not, but that still doesn't mean that I'm gonna buy this.

576
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,350
但你说过
But you said--

577
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,300
真不知道要怎么说你才明白
Look, I don't know how to explain this to you any better.

578
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,300
梦想和才华是有差别的
There is a difference between a dream and a talent.

579
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,190
抱歉
Look, I'm sorry.

580
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,170
如果有人可以让你...
If there's someone that you--

581
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,090
他是血友病患者
He's a hemophiliac.

582
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:35,220
所以他才对血如此着迷
That would explain his obsession with blood.

583
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,480
他一流血就会害怕死亡
He can't bleed without a fear of dying.

584
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,640
正因如此  他才在作画以前先把血浆
It's also why he would separate the plasma from the blood

585
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,800
从血液里分离出来
before painting with it.

586
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,900
这是一种古老的疗法
It's an antiquated treatment,

587
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,610
血友病患者在自己的伤口注射血浆
but some hemophiliacs can inject plasma into their wounds,

588
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,430
加强在他们体内
kick-starting the clotting

589
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,850
已经失效的血凝能力
process that's ineffective in their own systems.

590
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,040
说吧
Talk about it.

591
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,530
美妞  我需要一份旧金山的血友病患者名单
Hey, girlie, I need a list of hemophiliacs in San Francisco.

592
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,450
撒的网可真大啊
Vague. So vague. Ok.

593
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,330
加西亚  他的执念非常强烈
Garcia, for his obsession to be this profound,

594
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,090
所以他很可能病得很重
he most likely has the more severe version of the disease.

595
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,170
B型血友病[克里斯马斯病]
It's type B Christmas disease.

596
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,620
里德  你平安无事  我很开心
Reid, I'm happy to hear you made it safe and sound.

597
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,210
谢谢关心  加西亚
Thank you, Garcia.

598
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,460
B型血友病  听起来很惨啊
Ok, Christmas disease. It does not sound very jolly.

599
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,660
此病是以第一个确诊病人
It was named after the first known case,

600
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,970
史蒂芬・克里斯马斯命名的
Stephen Christmas.

601
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,260
我找到15个患此病的人
All right, I got 15 people who have trouble clotting.

602
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,290
他的生活应该与艺术有关
He wouldn't stray too far from the art world.

603
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:19,920
他应该从事
Most likely works in and

604
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,080
与艺术相关的工作  但他本人并非艺术家
around the art community, but not as an artist.

605
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,900
而且他很孤僻  查查从事无需和外界
And he's a loner. So look for people with jobs

606
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,430
打交道的工作的人
where they don't interact with the public.

607
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,610
现在范围缩小到三人
Yeah. Yeah. I got 3.

608
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,740
当地超市的采购部门职员  艺术博客作家
Stock boy at a local supermarket, an art blogger,

609
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,690
和一个托管人
and a custodian.

610
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,930
几名被害人的血型均不相同
The victims have different blood types.

611
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,910
如果他要注射提取出的血浆
If he's taking the plasma out of the blood,

612
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,500
那他应该是个全适受血者
he must be a universal recipient.

613
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,880
他们中有人是AB型RH阳性血吗
Any of them with AB-positive blood?

614
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,580
这条很具体  我搜搜看
Specificity. I dig it.

615
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,610
再结合一下名字里带字母B的...
Ok, if I factor in those "B" names I was working on...

616
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,300
揭开真面目咯
And bingo is his name-o.

617
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,290
他叫布莱恩・休斯
Actually, his name is Bryan Hughes.

618
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,130
是一名AB阳性血友病患者
He is an AB-positive hemophiliac

619
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,630
在海湾区艺术馆当守卫
who works as a janitor at the Bay Area Museum of Art,

620
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,880
不劳你们多问
and before you ask, yes,

621
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,490
他的地址已发到你们手机上
his address has been sent to your phones.

622
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,770
你最棒了  宝贝
You're the best, baby girl.

623
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,100
戴夫  你和布莱克去艺术馆
Dave, you and Blake take the museum.

624
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,710
其余人去他的住处
The rest of us will take the residence.

625
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,640
我没事
I'm ok.

626
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,230
那就好  还是很高兴看到你
Yeah. But it's good to see you.

627
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:15,420
如果你还没休整好  真的不必着急回来
You really don't need to be here if you're not ready.

628
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,200
这要花些时间
This is going to take time.

629
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,520
多长时间
How much time?

630
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,260
很难说
It's hard to say.

631
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,240
我们都在你身边
But we're all here for you.

632
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,630
谢谢
Thank you.

633
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,800
有何发现  美女
Hey, what you got, mama?

634
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,100
发现有关这个布莱恩・休斯的一条重大信息
A compelling piece of information about this Bryan Hughes.

635
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,710
第一起凶案发生的三周前
3 weeks before the first murder,

636
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,090
他出了一场车祸
he was involved in a car accident.

637
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,150
受伤了吗
Was he injured?

638
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,500
没有  如果你看到我正看的这些图
Uh, no. And if you were looking at the pictures I am

639
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,940
一定会觉得这是个奇迹
you would say that is a miracle.

640
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,530
他可能由此产生了自己刀枪不入的想法
It may have given him the impression he couldn't be hurt.

641
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,670
另一名司机受伤了  流血过多致死
The other driver was hurt. She bled to death.

642
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,780
休斯报了警
Hughes called 911,

643
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,230
但没有提及还有另一名司机
failed to mention there was another driver involved.

644
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,450
急救人员赶到时  她已身亡
By the time emergency crews got there, she had already died.

645
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,420
谢谢  加西亚
Thanks, Garcia.

646
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,800
眼看着另一个女人流血致死
Watching the other woman bleed to death

647
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,090
这一定就是导火索
must have been the trigger.

648
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,820
有什么发现  帅哥
Hey, what you got, pretty boy?

649
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,780
休斯可能已经有了下一个作案目标
I think Hughes may have his next victim.

650
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,880
一个叫艾伦・阿奇尔的刚刚来报案说他的老板不见了
An Alan Archer just came in and reported his boss missing.

651
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,430
麦迪森・赖利在教会区有一间画廊
Madison Riley owns an art gallery in the Mission District.

652
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,550
据称现场有血迹和打斗痕迹
Said there was blood, signs of a struggle.

653
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,720
这次休斯甚至在墙上留了一副自己的画作
Hughes even left a painting of his on the wall this time.

654
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,940
同样的签名  而且绝对是用血画的
It's the same signature and it's definitely made of blood,

655
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,250
这让我想起梅芙的跟踪狂
which got me thinking about Maeve's stalker.

656
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,510
如果这家伙是一个寻求认同的扭曲的艺术家
If this guy's a tortured artist searching for approval,

657
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,750
那么他应该认为只有一种方法能得到认同
in his mind there may be only one way to get it.

658
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,550
自杀
Suicide.

659
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,710
多谢  里德
Thanks, Reid.

660
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,900
我全身心地投入这些画作
I put my heart and my soul into those paintings.

661
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,340
你将亲眼见证我卓越的创作能力
You're going to get a first-hand look at what I'm capable of creating.

662
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,640
布莱恩・休斯  联邦调查局
Bryan Hughes, FBI.

663
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,540
不  我必须让她看到
No! I have to make her see.

664
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,960
把刀放下
Put down the knife.

665
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,860
布莱恩  我明白
Bryan, I understand.

666
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,720
不  你不明白
No, you don't.

667
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,930
你怎么可能明白
How could you possibly understand?

668
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,640
因为我看过你的大作
Because I've seen your work.

669
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,010
我知道可能你现在还无人赏识
And I know you may not be appreciated now,

670
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,980
但我向你保证  如果你放下刀
but I promise you, if you put down the knife,

671
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,260
我会保证让世人欣赏到你的艺术
I will make sure that people see your art,

672
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,210
而且没人能够忽视
and no one will be able to ignore it.

673
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,780
这就是我想要的  那是我应得的
It's all I want. I deserve that.

674
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,270
那就把刀放下  我们把这事解决
Then put down the knife, and let's figure this out.

675
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,270
你知道梵高死前卖了多少幅画吗
You know how many paintings Van Gogh sold before he died?

676
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,060
布莱恩  别犯傻
Bryan, don't do it.

677
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,400
两幅
Two.

678
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,040
他卖了两幅
He sold two.

679
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,270
别逼我们出手
Don't make us do this.

680
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,200
我必须让你看到我
I gotta make you see me.

681
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,070
让急救人员到楼上来
Get the EMTs upstairs.

682
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,860
这里还有一具尸体
We've got another body over here.

683
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,740
我猜五篮
Well, I counted 5 baskets.

684
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,040
七篮  但我觉得隔壁的卡瓦诺小姐
7, but I think Ms. Cavanaugh next door

685
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,460
可能拿了几个走
may have taken a couple.

686
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,570
真的很抱歉  如果我之前有点...
I'm really sorry if I've been kind of...

687
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:12,870
斯宾塞  不用
Spence. You don't...

688
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,040
孩子
Kid.

689
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,500
我找你  不是为了让你到现场来帮忙
I didn't mean for you to come all the way out there.

690
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,510
我知道
I know.

691
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,250
如果你有任何需要
Listen, if you need anything at all,

692
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,720
开口就好
you just have to ask.

693
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,530
事实上  如果你们不介意的话
Actually, if you guys don't mind,

694
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,210
我想请你们帮个忙
I could use some help with something.

695
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,290
说
Name it.

696
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:21,280
有时最难的并非放下过去
"Sometimes the hardest part isn't letting go,

697
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:25,420
而是学会重新开始
but rather, learning to start over."

698
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,370
作家妮可・索邦
Nicole Sobon.
