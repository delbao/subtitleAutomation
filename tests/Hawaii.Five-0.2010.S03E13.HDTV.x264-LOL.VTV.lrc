Warden Grier.
Warden Grier, one of my men is inside.
[30:09.45]I just found out, Commander.
We're doing everything we can,
but I have a riot on my hands, and I have a protocol.
[30:15.12]You have a protocol? Where was your protocol
when Lieutenant Kelly was locked in your prison?
Guards under your supervision
[30:21.24]conspired to do this. This happened on your watch.
What's your plan of action to get my man out of there?
A dozen of my men are unaccounted for.
[30:28.77]Some injured, some worse.
I won't risk any more lives.
Lieutenant Kelly's on his own.
[30:35.52]We're going in now.
[30:45.61](tires squealing)
[30:52.38]Got my bird all warmed up for you, sistah.
Why's SWAT not taking care of business?
[30:58.59]They got a whole flock of choppers ready to go.
'Cause the warden won't let anything up in the air
over Halawa till he gives the go-ahead.
[31:04.73]And we're not waiting for permission.
[31:13.69]Hey, I got 62 more payments on this girl.
Be gentle, please!
[31:19.38]You may want to step back.
[31:40.68](prisoners shouting)
[32:13.78]You and me-- we've had our issues.
But bringing you this cop means we're all good, you feel me?
[32:20.50]Sure. I feel you.
[32:28.28]Lieutenant.
Glad we'll be able to finish what we started.
[32:34.32](groans)
(groans)
(men shouting)
[32:41.34]Things are different, little more painful,
when you can't hide behind the badge and gun.
(grunts)
[32:48.05]You're not better than us.
You're one of us.
[32:54.67]You belong here.
You turned on other cops,
[33:02.06]locked me up.
I only survived because of one man--
[33:08.52]Frank Delano.
The man you killed.
Delano...
[33:15.49]murdered my wife.
He would've killed my cousin
and me, too, if he had the chance.
[33:21.08]His brother... don't see it that way.
He put me in here.
[33:27.67]And now you die.
Kaleo!
You're making a mistake.
[33:34.25]Why do you care what happens to him?
I don't.
I care what happens to me.
You know this guy ain't just some cop.
[33:40.10]He's Five-O.
Sure, you kill him, you get a few seconds
of satisfaction-- but this man's your leverage.
[33:47.69]You keep him alive a little while longer...
...you just might buy yourself a ticket out of here.
[33:55.15](indistinct chatter)
(groans)
Call them, Kaleo.
Call Five-O.
[34:01.92]Find out what they're willing
to trade for him.
[34:08.50]On second thought...
why would I trust a snitch who gave me up to Five-O?
[34:14.62](punch strikes) (grunts)
(excited chatter)
Put him in a cell.
I'll deal with him later.
