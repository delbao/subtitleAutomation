继续说   - 她用酒瓶袭击他  
Go on. - She hits him with the gin bottle, 

148
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:03,279
他"砰"地一声开枪
blam, he shoots.

149
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,998
被人从背后一刺  他转过身来
Gets stabbed from behind. He turns.

150
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,639
他倒下之时动脉里的血喷射到墙上
He falls with the stripe of blood.

151
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,854
以及Lucy身上  
Towards Lucy. 

152
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:11,798
此时他又开一枪 没中  看到了吗
But he shoots and misses. See that?

153
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:15,520
没打中是因为他在转身 瞄准另一个人  砰
Missing because he's turning, aiming for another. Blam.

154
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,439
砰
Blam.

155
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,479
砰
Blam.

156
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,399
砰  瞄准的是用刀刺他的人
Blam. Towards whoever cut him.

157
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
最后一枪 第六枪在哪里
Where's the last? The sixth?

158
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,440
- 比其他几抢要低 长官   - 确是如此
- Lower than the others, sir. - It is.

159
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,839
没错 不过 会不会是子弹从哪擦过改变了方向
It is, but... was it diverted?

160
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,120
擦到哪里
By what?

161
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,479
上校 看到这个了吗
You see this, Captain?

162
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,918
一共六颗子弹  她头上一颗
We have six bullets. We have one in her head.

163
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,878
四颗直接射向墙壁 顺序合理明了
Four passing directly into the wall in a correlating tangent.

164
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,367
最后一颗 也就是第六颗 
And the last, the sixth, 

165
00:08:46,368 --> 00:08:48,600
可能转向了 然后穿过这个窗户射了出去
perhaps diverted through this window.

166
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,680
要的就是那颗子弹
Then that's the slug we need.

167
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
找到你了
Got ya.

168
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,320
它穿过玻璃之前的确打中过一个人  上面有血
It did pass through a body on its way out. It's blooded.

169
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,519
也就是说
Then...

170
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,800
第四个人站在
a fourth stood...

171
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,998
这里  手握杀死这家伙的匕首
here. In their hand, the knife that killed this man

172
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:22,819
从他身上 我们可以找到
and with him the answer as to why

173
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,798
他在死前打爆这位女士脑袋的原因
he blew this woman's brains out of her before he died.

174
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,906
标记好这些尸体位置
These bodies, mark where

175
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:28,798
然后把它们送到你的验尸间
they lay and they are for your dead room.

176
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,798
警长 封锁这间房子  真相就在其间
Sergeant, keep this room sealed. There will be truth in it,

177
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,480
但我们必须一点一点地调查 寻求答案
but we must work it inch by every inch to find it.

178
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,799
你是警察吗
You're police?

179
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,680
我是伦敦郡议会的Stanley Bone
My name is Stanley Bone of the LCC.

180
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,639
我叫Reid  是H警区的
Mine Reid. H Division.

181
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,178
是什么风把我们新郡议会议员
What does it brings a board member

182
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:51,440
吹到贫民窟清拆这儿来了
of our new county council out to a slum clearance?

183
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:55,479
您将您的房子提供给这些交房后无处可居之民了吗
Do you offer your home to those here rendered without?

184
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,360
Reid先生 我是制造这场拆迁的
Mr Reid, I am advocate for the railway company

185
00:09:58,361 --> 00:10:00,159
铁路公司的支持者
that makes this incursion.

186
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,798
不管是什么吸引你来此 这事发生在我们的地盘
Whatever has called you here takes place on its land.

187
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,960
我因谋杀案而来
It is murder that calls me here.

188
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:07,479
谋杀案?  谁被谋杀了
Murder? Of who?

189
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,400
一名收租者和房客
Of a rent collector and tenant.

190
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,919
很遗憾 探长
I am sorry, Inspector.

191
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,079
不过尽管我会为那个死去的可怜人祈祷
But whilst I pray for the poor departed,

192
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,718
这座房子必须今日拆迁
that building comes down today.

193
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:21,078
不行  在我搞清楚事情始末之前 谁也不准拆
No longer. It stays upright until I know what took place there.

194
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,838
那在你调查租务纠纷之时
And these workmen will stand idle on full wage

195
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,000
我们雇佣的这些全职工人都要一直在此无所事事吗
while you discern the details of a rent dispute?

196
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,960
不论我要调查什么 他们都不准开工
Whatever it is that's discerned here, yes, they will.

197
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,760
或者说您并不支持警察工作?
Or are you not also advocate of the police?

198
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,559
当然支持
Yes, of course.

199
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,440
探长 您可要尽善其责
You must do your duty, Inspector.

200
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,151
现在怎样 探长大人  
How now, Inspector? 

201
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:47,799
是来看拆迁的进度的吗
Come to see the march of progress, have we?

202
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,718
看看那些寻求栖身之地的人能否如愿?
Those who now must find their shelter where they can?

203
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,339
那是你关心的事   
That your story, is it? 

204
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,960
我可是个有同情心之人
Oh, I am a man of compassion.

205
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:58,479
愚昧之人要么在这样的地方干活谋生
The benighted souls who must make their lives in such places

206
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,080
要么丧命于此
or meet their deaths there.

207
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,038
透露一两个名字就够了 探长大人
Just a name or two, Inspector, eh?

208
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,912
这边总有人会告诉我的  
Someone here shall tell me eventually. 

209
00:11:05,913 --> 00:11:07,318
为什么你就不能说呢
Why should it not be you?

210
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:08,879
因为这会给你的生活
Because I would make your life harder 

211
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,480
带来不必要的麻烦 Best先生
than it need be, Mr Best.

212
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:12,800
而不是更加简单
Not the reverse.

213
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,958
不会有事的 Lucy  会好起来的
It'll be all right, Lucy. It'll be all right.

214
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,558
Artherton 派一辆车到圣乔治十字旗附近去
Artherton, a Maria for St George's Cross.

215
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,558
{\pos(192,26)}圣乔治十字旗:英格兰国旗

216
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:34,680
令Jackson上校全速返回
Have Captain Jackson return with all... speed.

217
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:37,480
好了好了  乖  嘘
There, there. Come on. Shush.

218
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,560
你怎么来了
What's brought you here?

219
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:44,239
我们的Lucy 探长
Erm, our Lucy, Inspector.

220
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,566
Susan女士让我来看看她   
Miss Susan sent me to check on her. 

221
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:47,600
她的情况如何
And how do you find her?

222
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,279
如您所见 Reid先生  她沉默于痛苦之中
As you see her, Mr Reid. Just... silent in her distress.

223
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,840
- 回家吧 姑娘   - 是 长官
- Get home, girl. - Yes, sir.

224
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,998
那位姑娘的到来似乎让她平静了一些 长官
She seemed calmed by the girl's presence, sir.

225
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,731
- 我以为这有益于她   - 没关系的
- I thought it conducive. - Never mind that,

226
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:07,166
Artherton  你有没有调查一下她   
Artherton. Have you traced her? 

227
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:08,200
我没有 长官  这个小伙子调查了
Not myself, sir. The lad.

228
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,000
说吧 Hobbs
Well, Hobbs?

229
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,919
长官 对我来说 那个女孩只是看起来很悲痛
Well, it's only that the girl seems sad, to me, sir.

230
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,276
并不坏   - 不坏   
Not bad. - No. 

231
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:20,319
如您所说 她曾戴过镣铐
And like you said, she's worn irons before now,

232
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,489
因此我到各个收容所转了转   
so I did a round of the asylums. 

233
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,638
有没有查出什么
And you found knowledge of her?

234
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,918
有的 长官  在贝思纳尔格林的云雀宅
Yes, sir. The Lark House at Bethnal Green.

235
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,344
他们有没有派人来   
And do they send someone? 

236
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:28,880
来了一位Crabbe医生
A Dr Crabbe comes.

237
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,959
- Karl Crabbe亲自来了?   - 是的长官
- Karl Crabbe himself? - Sir.

238
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,518
他在歇斯底里症研究方面颇有成就
He's made a progress with hysterics

239
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,280
目前这一领域的医生还无人能敌
that no other doctor of the mind has yet.

240
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,078
干得好 Hobbs  你做得对
Good work, Hobbs. You did right.

241
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,172
选两个人 乘警车去找Drake警长吧
Choose two men, take a Maria to Sergeant Drake.

242
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:42,598
他会指示你该做什么
He'll have instructions for you.

243
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,440
- 遵命 长官   - 把手铐的钥匙给我
- Yes, sir. - Give me the keys to those cuffs.

244
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,680
坐下
Sit.

245
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,000
不  不 孩子  我不是要你来此做这些的
No. No, child. That is not what is... required of you here.

246
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,560
你有没有哪里受伤
Are you wounded in any way?

247
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,919
坐下吧
Sit.

248
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,239
我只希望你开口说话
All I want from you is to talk.

249
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,840
只要您高兴 长官
Whatever pleases you, sir.

250
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,040
喝吧
Drink this.

251
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,960
你还记得是因为什么来到这里吗
Can you remember what it was brought you here?

252
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:47,359
在狗脖儿胡同发生了什么
What happened at the Dog's Neck?

253
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,319
我的妈妈被杀了 长官
My mama killed, sir.

254
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,560
不仅仅是你的妈妈吧
Not just your mother.

255
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,279
还有一个男人
A man, too.

256
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,120
没错  你认识他吗
Yes. Do you know him?

257
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,520
你看到了什么
What did you see?

258
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,523
恕我冒昧 Eames小姐  
Forgive me, Miss Eames. 

259
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:04,760
他的血溅了你一身
His blood was shed all upon you.

260
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,360
长官 我可以离开了吗
May I go now, sir?

261
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,600
Lucy 你以为你现在在哪里
Where is it that you think you are, Lucy?

262
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,560
我忘了
I forget.

263
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,120

Your mama, this man...

264
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,599
帮我 也是帮你自己 好好想想
Help me, help you and think.

265
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,640
你看到了什么
What did you see?

266
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,520
我只看到了我的黑暗
Just my darkness.

267
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,760
当我醒来 他们就躺在我面前
When I woke up, they were there laid before me.

268
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:45,520
没有其他人?   
And not another soul? 

269
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:47,600
没有   - 你确定?
No-one. - You are sure?

270
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,800
长官 这世上没有我确定之事
There's nothing that I'm sure of in this world, sir.

271
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,120
Lucy 你知道你怀孕了吗
Lucy, you are aware that you are with child, are you not?

272
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,400
Crabbe医生
Dr Crabbe.

273
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,760
Lucy
Lucy!

274
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,319
Reid先生
Mr Reid.

275
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,679
医生
Sir.

276
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,838
我上个月听了您的演讲  在林肯律师学院
I heard you speak last month. At Lincoln's Inn.

277
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,806
在学院的那次  我认识的一个人跟我说
At the college! A man I know told me 

278
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:29,118
那天我语调低沉 内容单调
I droned that day.

279
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,720
那他一定没有认真听
He cannot have been listening.

280
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,119
现在你找到了我们的Lucy 并照顾她
And now you have found and cared for our Lucy.

281
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,039
Crabbe医生 我想告诉您

Eames小姐的妈妈今天被杀害了
Miss Eames' mother is killed this day.

283
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,679
哦 我可怜的孩子
Oh, my poor dear girl.

284
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,898
被杀害的还有另一个人 
And another man, too, 

285
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:46,560
名为Roach  您认识他吗?
the name of Roach. Do you know him, sir?

286
00:15:46,561 --> 00:15:48,879
不 我不认识  Lucy怀孕了?
No, I do not. Was Lucy present?

287
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,039
是的
She was.

288
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,560
但是什么都不记得了?
But remembers not a thing?

289
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,638
把这些尸体送到我的验尸房去
Get both these bodies to my dead room!

290
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,720
谁出了差错就去协助我验尸
The man who drops them will be assisting me at autopsy.

291
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,600
不要  等等  等等
No! Wait! Wait!

292
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,160
快抬走  快  迅速点
Take them away now! Hurry! Hurry!

293
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,760
Reid 很 很抱歉
Reid, I... I'm sorry.

294
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,359
她患有癫痫?
She is epileptic?

295
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,319
她受癫痫折磨 没错  还有其他病症
She is ailed by that, yes. Other conditions, also.

296
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,358
探长 我知道你还想继续审问她
Inspector, I know you must question her further

297
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:39,360
但你再次需要她之前 我要先带回去照顾她
but I would lodge her in my care until you next have need of her.

298
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,998
Artherton 准备文件
Artherton, prepare the papers.

299
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:44,400
Davis 帮我抱起她
Davis, can we lift her?

300
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:46,519
谢谢
Thank you.

301
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,760
好了 Lucy  没事了 没事了
There Lucy. All is well, all is well.

302
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,598
Crabbe医生 在您离开之前我想再问一句
Dr Crabbe, one last question before you go.

303
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,798
Eames小姐做您的病人已经多久了?
For how long has Miss Eames been a patient of yours?

304
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,598
两年多一点
A little over two years now,

305
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:05,118
不过她不是一直跟我住在一起
but she is not permanently resident with me.

306
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,718
您没有一直照管着她吗
You keep no watch over her?

307
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,234
探长 要想治好她的病 
Inspector, to find her health, 

308
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,438
让她感觉自己像你我一样
it is of considerable importance

309
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,998
正常地生活无比重要
that Lucy's life feel as commonplace as yours or mine.

310
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,239
如果让她觉得我们在评判她的一举一动 
That cannot be the case 

311
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,360
那恢复健康便是无望
if she feel we assess her every move.

312
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:20,239
她不舒服的时候 就去找我
When she is ill, she comes to me.

313
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,160
没事的时候 就爱怎么生活就怎么生活
When well, she lives as she pleases.

314
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,680
不好意思
Excuse me.

315
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,399
长官  这些小家伙们
Sir. These nippers?

316
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,118
我知道一个地方可以收养他们
I have an idea where they may rest

317
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,600
在他们得到更好的归宿之前
until we know better what will become of them.

318
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,574
Goren小姐  Goren小姐 很抱歉
Miss Goren? Miss Goren, I am sorry.

319
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,959
我又来麻烦您了
I come to impose on you once more.

320
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,959
哦  朋友之间不必见外 探长
Oh! We are friends now, Inspector.

321
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,000
想来就来 完全不必道歉
You must never apologise for your visit.

322
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,519
这位小姑娘是Betsy
This is Betsy.

323
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,680
你好啊 Betsy
Hello, Betsy!

324
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,360
孩子们 快来欢迎小妹妹Betsy
Girls, say hello to Betsy.

325
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,758
这个可怜的孩子经历了怎样的故事
What is this poor child's story?

326
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,278
她的妈妈死了 她姐姐...
Er, her mother is dead and her sister...

327
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,720
她姐姐暂时照顾不了她
Her sister is of no use to her for now.

328
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:22,359
没有爸爸或叔叔什么的吗
No father or uncle?

329
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,638
这个家庭就是被男人毁掉的 Goren小姐
It's men that are the ruin of this family, Miss Goren.

330
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,320
不仅仅是这个家庭 好多都是如此 探长
Oh, this family and many like them, Inspector.

331
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,079
你不这么认为吗
You disagree?

332
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,640
哦 不 不是的 只是 我妻子也会这样说 
No, no. No, merely, my wife would say the same.

333
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,861
Reid夫人一定是一位理智聪慧 
Mrs Reid must be a woman 

334
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:40,079
心智明晰的女人
of great sense and clarity.

335
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,999
没错 她是
She is that, yes.



336
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,800
那我希望与她一见
Then I would like to meet her.

337
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,480
再次多谢 Goren小姐
My many thanks again, Miss Goren.

338
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,000
如果有什么消息 我会首先通知你
If I have news, you'll be the first to know.

339
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,839
你还记得你的屋子吗 Lucy
You remember, Lucy? Your room?

340
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,040
一切都没变
Just as it ever was.

341
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,318
奇怪 就好像她从不曾在这里过
Strange, were like she weren't even there.

342
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,840
几乎都认不出我来
Barely even recognised me.'

343
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,255
总之 我不理解你为什么
Anyways, I don't know why you're

344
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,358
要对她如此不遗余力的讨好
getting yourself in such a palaver about her.

345
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,856
你是不是认为她像Ellen Terry一样
Think she gave two tosses for


346
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,856
{\pos(192,26)}Ellen Terry 著名的莎士比亚话剧演员

347
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:57,438
四处漂泊后就能身价倍增?
you when she swanned off like Ellen Terry herself?

348
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:59,320
丫头 她可比你金贵多了
She was worth ten of you, girl.

349
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,320
哦 Rose 过来过来  我真的很抱歉
Oh, Rose, come here, come here. I'm so sorry.

350
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,720
我为她担心  而且我感到自责
I fear for her. And I blame myself.

351
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,759
警长 把Reid找来
Get Reid, Sergeant.

352
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,159
是 Munro警监
Yes, Commissioner Munro.

353
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,200
我要说两件事 Reid
Two issues, Reid.

354
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,599
第一 不管这是谁做的 这个人是从背后下的手
One, whoever did this. From behind.

355
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,558
他是从低处向上发力
They had to push upwards from underneath to do so.

356
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,567
所以我推测他的身高较矮  
So I reckon they would be shorter. 

357
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:34,958
刀的长度大约十厘米
The blade's about four inches.

358
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:38,840
很锋利 应该是折叠刀  而且制作精良
A good point, a switch-blade most likely. A well-made one.

359
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:40,359
那么第二点呢
The second issue?

360
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,320
这个女人
This woman.

361
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,920
子宫里长了子宫肌瘤
There are fibroids in her womb.

362
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,319
解释一下
Explain.

363
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,359
类似溃疡 时间久了子宫就会畸形
It's like cankers. Over time they deform the uterus.

364
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,079
会影响生育吗
The children?

365
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,319
她已经十年未曾生育了
She ain't been confined for over ten years.

366
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,080
那是为什么 莫非那些孩子是Lucy的
So what then? Are they Lucy's?

367
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,598
长官 警监Munro让您过去
Commissioner Munro calls for you, Sir.

368
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,320
他要你陪他去一趟狗脖儿胡同的铁路挖掘现场
You're to go with him to the Dog's Neck railway excavation.

369
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,238
那里才开发了几周
They are but a few weeks old,

370
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:22,280
但已经带来了亘古不散的寒意
but these places already have the chill of eternity.

371
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,399
长官 你为什么叫我来
Why bring me here, Sir?

372
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,194
Reid 只想让你亲自听听这个人的话 
Just hear the man out, Reid. 

373
00:21:28,195 --> 00:21:29,960
他的意见是我们不该忽视的
His concern should be ours, also.

374
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,960
探长 探长 请这边来
Inspector. Inspector, please!

375
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,438
谢谢你迅速赶到
Thank you for responding so speedily to my invitation.

376
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,238
我很欣慰 特别是对你 探长
Yourself in particular, Inspector.

377
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:46,998
有话直说 Bone 我那里还有两个谋杀案等着呢
Get to it, Bone, I have two murders above us need investigation.

378
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:50,198
我一定会速战速决 不多叨扰 Reid先生
And I will have you returned to them in short order, Mr Reid.

379
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:52,678
等你看过这里到底在修建什么之后
As soon as you've seen just what is built here.

380
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,480
铺设铁路而已 多新鲜啊
Track is laid. For a railway. It is nothing new.

381
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,719
或许不新鲜  但绝对有新意
Perhaps not new. But newly efficient.

382
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,280
所有人 离开铁路一米
Every man - a yard back from the line!

383
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,113
有500伏特的电压运行在
500 volts run beneath the

384
00:22:20,114 --> 00:22:23,199
利物浦大街的枢纽站的河水下
rivers of the junction at Liverpool Street,

385
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,799
从那里分支 分别向东 西方 延伸 
split there to travel east, west and onwards, Mr Reid.

386
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,988
Reid先生 不停地延伸着 不停地
Onwards, for ever.

387
00:22:28,989 --> 00:22:32,158
延伸过下一个世纪 再下一个
Down the next century and the one that follows -

388
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,678
组成一张有机的运输网
an organism of transport.

389
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,958
每一个区都彼此相连
Every borough connected, one to the other.

390
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:38,558
旅行不再仅仅是富人的特权 
The poor, sir - not simply the rich - will travel,

391
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,307
因为旅费会大幅下降
for the cost of half a pot of jam,

392
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:42,158
从城市的一边到另一边花费无几
from one end of our city to another.

393
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,118
随着每天他们的视野的开拓
Their everyday horizon extended,

394
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,798
他们的志向也会相应提高
their aspirations improved accordingly.

395
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,329
Bone先生 我从未质疑过
Mr Bone, I have never contested

396
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,600
这项工程对人们的生活的意义
the value of this machinery to people's lives.

397
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:51,799
那就促进它吧
Then assist it.

398
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,598
探长 我们为这个事业所投入的资金网
Inspector, the investment structure we have constructed for this

399
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,497
犹如我们即将建造的铁路网 
venture, it is as reticulated 

400
00:22:57,498 --> 00:22:58,958
都层层相套 环环相扣
as the network we would build.

401
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:01,398
每一个环节都有一个完工保障
Each section of line has a completion guarantee.

402
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:02,583
只有保证这个环节完成
That guarantee fulfilled,

403
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:04,478
下一部分的建筑资金才会发放
the next tranche of capital is released.

404
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:06,920
如果地面上的拆迁人员继续无所事事
Should the demolition crew above ground stand idle

405
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:11,559
我们这里整个工程就会有毁于一旦的危险
for many hours more, we risk the collapse of the entire venture.

406
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,800
所以我拜托你 先生 求求你了
I beg you, sir. I beg you.

407
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,520
让他们继续开工吧
Let them proceed.

408
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,518
日安 先生们
Good day to you, fine sirs.

409
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:22,678
这位是谁啊
Who is this gentleman?

410
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,078
他叫Best 他是星报的撰稿记者
His name is Best. He writes for The Star.

411
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,718
议员先生 您并不认得我 但我今天是来结交您的
You know me not, Councillor. But I come to know you, Sir.

412
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:29,078
这里是私人产业
This is private land.

413
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:32,118
马上滚蛋 否则Reid探长会用靴底送你一程
Remove yourself or Inspector Reid shall do so with his boot.

414
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,440
可此刻我站在一块公共区域上
And this here is common land

415
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:35,518
在此我想提问Bone先生几个问题
from which I shall ask Mr Bone my questions,

416
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,160
就是他是如何评价 在他投身郡议会的
of how he feels, four months into its life,

417
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:40,399
四个月里 议会的作为呢
our new county council proceeds.

418
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,919
如果议会启蒙公民的职能 还没有被议员们
If its civic enlightenments are not compromised by the...

419
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,079
追逐铜臭的商业心所瓦解的话
commercial instincts of its councillors.

420
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,198
我不想在这接着听你含沙射影了
I shall not stand here and listen to these insinuations.

421
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:53,358
我们所做的一切都是为了整个城市
Everything we do, we do for the good of this city

422
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,960
为了城市里百姓大众们的利益
and the benefit of those who build their lives within it.

423
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:58,279
警监 探员 我先失陪了
Commissioner, Inspector.

424
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,998
先生 我很确定人们会感谢你的付出
I'm sure they appreciate your dedication, sir.

425
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:04,040
尤其是您对您自家幸福的牺牲
Yes, the sacrifices you have made to your own life.

426
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:08,519
您的妻子 眼睁睁看着海水长驱直入进了霍夫镇
Your wife, watching the sea roll in all alone down in Hove.

427
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,639
您膝下无子 
No children to comfort you.

428
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,946
不能享受天伦之乐
The pleasures of a home

429
00:24:11,947 --> 00:24:14,560
却为了他人的幸福而活
life foregone in pursuit of others' happiness.

430
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:16,319
先生 这一定令您伤怀
It must ail you, Sir.

431
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,760
即便您性格强韧 也必定黯然神伤吧
It must play on those finely-tuned nerves of yours.

432
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,920
还是说您已经在其他方面找到慰藉了呢
Or do you find other ways of easing that pain...?

433
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,119
Best 你说够了没  快滚
Best! Enough. Get gone.

434
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,359
悉听尊便 探长
Whatever you say, Inspector.

435
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,120
但我还会回来的
But do not think me gone long.

436
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,126
就我个人来说 Bone先生对未来的规划
For myself, Mr Bone's vision

437
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:40,160
就是交通密集型城市的构想 我不置可否
of a liberal city commune is of little bearing.

438
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,399
是的 长官
No, sir.

439
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,678
对我而言重要的是
What is of greater importance to me is this 

440
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,238
一旦一个既成的平民窟
that each occasion a slum is raised to the ground,

441
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:50,078
被整洁的钢筋水泥所取代
it is replaced by the type of brick and clean steel on which

442
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,998
那么滋生罪恶的温床也就不存在了
the bacteria of the criminal classes can no longer fester.

443
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:57,440
要是我们能把大量游民送到外面的广阔世界
The greater the number of homeless we send to the wider world,

444
00:24:57,441 --> 00:25:00,319
我们的犯罪率就会显著下降
the faster our measure of crime falls.

445
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,118
我就是这个意思 探长
You have my meaning, inspector.

446
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,499
不管你的人在贫民窟里有什么要事
Whatever it is your men do in that rookery,

447
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,718
都要在天黑之前干完
it stops by end of day

448
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:08,280
否则 他们就会发现自己置身在碎石瓦砾中了
or they will find themselves amidst the rubble.

449
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,879
总会留下蛛丝马迹的
'There will be sign.'

450
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,598
也许这人行踪鬼魅 如同幽灵
This person might have vanished as if a ghost,

451
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,118
但他终究不是幽灵
but a ghost they are not.

452
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,709
他所经过的地方
Wherever they have passed, the space

453
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,918
必定会印刻下他的所作所为
through which they have done so must bear witness.

454
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,360
咱们三个 咱们还得一起再检查一次这个地方
We three - we take one more pass of this place together.

455
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,160
快点跪下来查啊
On your knees, then.

456
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,520
Hobbs 发现什么了
What, Hobbs? What is it?

457
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,520
是杜松子酒 先生
It's gin, Sir.

458
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,919
长官  快看这个 金色的头发
Sir? Look at this, blonde hair.

459
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,760
极有可能是那个母亲的
The mother's, most likely.

460
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,279
那是什么
What's that?

461
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,519
是香草
It's a herb.

462
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,639
掉下来的 被碾压过
Dropped. Brushed aside.

463
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,400
是我以前闻过的味道
One that I have smelled before.

464
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,483
Hobbs  是时候去多了解一下
Hobbs. It's time we knew more 

465
00:26:31,484 --> 00:26:32,558
死去的Roach先生了
about our dead Mr Roach.

466
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,118
去公司登记局  弄清楚有关于他的工作的情况
Get to Companies House. Find out what you can about his work,

467
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,415
看看他到底是给自己收租金 
whether he collected on his own behalf 

468
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,798
还是帮其他人收   - 是 长官
or for others. - Sir.

469
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,398
警长 你跟我走
Sergeant - you're with me.

470
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,760
对于这里到底发生了什么 我已经有头绪了
I have a notion of what may have passed here.

471
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,440
到楼上去才能进一步 流氓
That's for upstairs, cheeky.

472
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,000
Drake警长
Sergeant Drake!

473
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,040
你这个瘦皮猴 快滚出去吧
Get your skinny prick out of here!

474
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,720
快叫Susan女士来
Fetch Miss Susan!

475
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,439
你要逮捕我吗 先生
Will you arrest me, Sir?

476
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,840
不会的 姑娘
No, girl.

477
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,200
我只是希望他不会白吃你的豆腐
I hope he's not left you out of pocket.

478
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,919
Drake先生 你真是太风趣了
Mr Drake, you do say the funniest things.

479
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,959
你的女主人呢 她在哪儿
Your mistress. Where is she?

480
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,398
最好告诉我你们是来突袭的
This had best be a raid.

481
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:19,510
如果你们大张旗鼓地过来只是为了说个晚安
If you've come simply to say your good-evenings,

482
00:27:19,511 --> 00:27:20,918
我可就要跟你们寻求赔偿了
I shall be seeking compensation.

483
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:22,419
跟说什么晚安半点儿关系没有  
No good-evenings. 

484
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,520
我们也不是来突然袭击的
This is not a raid, either.

485
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:25,599
我只是想来问几个问题 女士
I seek an interview, Madam.

486
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,919
跟我来  不过让你的警长就留在楼下吧
This way. But leave your sergeant down there.

487
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,320
这样他还能免费意淫我的小妞呢
He may moon at my girl gratis.

488
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,880
我在外面等你 长官
I'll be outside sir.

489
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,760
这是你好基友的屋子
Your accomplice's very own suite.

490
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,999
Hart小姐 请问您能谅解我吗
Will you indulge me, Miss Hart?

491
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,120
谅解我不厌其烦地叨扰您
Allow me to weary you with some details of my day?

492
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:05,240
你? 叨扰我? 探长
You? Weary me, Inspector?

493
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,399
你曾经送走的那个女孩
That girl you once ran.

494
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,600
那是Lucy 她是个好姑娘
Lucy. A good girl.

495
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,280
她离开我们这里 有了更好的归宿
She left for what we hoped were better times.

496
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:16,359
不管是不是真是更好的归宿
Better or no,

497
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,878
今天早晨她出现在我的警局 衣服上血迹斑斑
she appears this morning at my station, striped in blood,

498
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:20,798
为她死去的母亲恸哭
keening after her dead mother.

499
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,960
我听说这事儿了 也为她诚挚地哀悼
I've heard of it. And I mourn for her.

500
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,240
恩  的确
Hmm. Yes.

501
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
那个叫Roach的男人也一样 
And the man, too, Roach.

502
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,639
他的颈动脉被一个锋利的折叠刀切开
His carotid opened with a stab of a honed switch-blade.

503
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,558
我希望您不是在含沙射影些什么吧 Reid先生
I prefer you spare me that imagery, Mr Reid.

504
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,680
您已经敏感地联想到了什么 不是吗
Your sensitivities affronted, are they?

505
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,120
Jackson上校桌子上的这种植物
This plant on Captain Jackson's desk.

506
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:45,600
它怎么了
What of it?

507
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,079
薄荷 是不是
Pennyroyal, is it not?

508
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,598
我对那个男人放在房间里的东西可不感兴趣
What that man keeps in this room, I find I prefer not to inquire.

509
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,320
那让我来启发你吧
Then perhaps I might educate you?

510
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:57,999
这是我的荣幸
I'd be honoured.

511
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,565
薄荷叶 一旦被浸泡酿造
Pennyroyal, when brewed strong as an infusion,

512
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:01,960
就可能会导致流产
may bring on miscarriage.

513
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,605
真令人感到惊讶
I confess I am surprised a

514
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:09,799
一个做这种行当的女人竟然会不懂这个
woman in your line of work, ignorant of this.

515
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,738
我能说什么呢 Reid先生 
What can I say, Mr Reid? 

516
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:13,400
我们这的姑娘们都小心谨慎
We are cautious in this house.

517
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,777
我要说的是 Eames小姐
Miss Eames is, I would say, 

518
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:18,518
已经有近三个月的身孕了
a little under three month pregnant.

519
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,480
那我再次为她表示诚挚的哀悼
Then I mourn for her once more.

520
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,080
正如我所说的 小心谨慎
As I say - cautious.

521
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,399
你最好快去看看医生 Susan
You best attend to that, Susan.

522
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,480
枪伤很容易引起败血症的
A bullet wound might soon go septic.

523
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,758
想一想我会交待出谁的名字吧
Think of the names I can speak of!

524
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,638
想象你们有多少人来我这儿消遣过
The many men of yours whose pleasure's been found in my house!

525
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,507
他们比你的地位高多了   
Those ranked higher than you...! 

526
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:40,878
你们能快点弄走她吗
Will you get her locked down!

527
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:44,000
你  还有你 你们都曾是我的常客 座上宾
You! And you! And you have all been guests in my house!

528
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,440
跟我来 Jackson
With me, Jackson.

529
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,879
不 Reid
No, Reid!

530
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,480
我发誓 我对她的所作所为真的毫无头绪
I swear it, I have no clue as to what she's doing here.

531
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,759
装得真像啊 上校
How skilled you are, Captain.

532
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,965
你竟然能口口声声的说出
Your claims to know nothing

533
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:05,840
你对你自己屋檐下发生的事一无所知
of what takes place beneath your own roof.

534
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,879
我对我自己感到无比失望
I am dismayed at myself,

535
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,880
我竟然会相信一个如此破绽百出的人
that I would trust a man so transparently false.

536
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,066
你们两个 - 你和Susan 
The two of you - you and Susan 

537
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:19,519
由你们两个精心编造的谎言
the lies that you hide behind,

538
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,200
我眼睁睁地看着而没有验证的谎言
lies that I have allowed to go untested.

539
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:24,285
仅仅凭着自己愚蠢的直觉
Allowed in the foolish

540
00:31:24,286 --> 00:31:28,359
期许着这其中可能会有误会
instinct that some good might come from it!

541
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,240
你还值得我对你的信任吗
That you might be worth the faith that I have placed in you!

542
00:31:32,241 --> 00:31:33,519
我值得的 Reid
I am, Reid.

543
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,672
你现在是在盛怒之下 
You are in a rage 

544
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:36,400
我也理解你的愤怒 但是我...
and I understand that rage, but I...

545
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,599
不
No.

546
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,982
你明知道她的罪责
You knew of her guilt and

547
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,360
只有偷偷摸摸的人才会这样保守秘密
a man who holds secrets is a secretive man.

548
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,038
可是你也有权发表意见 不是么
And you have the right to pronounce on that, do you?

549
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,760
关于你所肩负的这个烂担子
That mess about your shoulder.

550
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,960
所有目睹了这件事的人 这个警局里的所有人
All who have laid eyes on it, every man in this station

551
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:03,639
对于这件事都三缄其口 即便这发生在他们之间
too afraid to talk about it even amongst themselves.

552
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,320
在那之后Drake有调查过吗
Does Drake enquire after it?

553
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:08,679
我敢打包票他是不会调查的
Because I'd lay money on it that he doesn't.

554
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,760
知道么 Reid 那是因为他对你忠心耿耿
Well, that's loyalty for you, Reid.

555
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,078
狗是不能质疑主人的辛勤和动机的
A dog unable to question the pain or motivation of the man

556
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,798
于是只好不安地把尾巴摇来摆去
that it tails about the place.

557
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,795
还有 我想说问你的是
Well, I shall ask you.

558
00:32:17,796 --> 00:32:19,880
我想知道你女儿到底出了什么...
I'd hear you speak of what befell your girl...

559
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,199
你又提她了 我压根不想在你做了那档子事后
You ever speak of her again, I shall not trouble myself with

560
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,399
再被你质问起这件破事儿 上校
asking after the secrets of your life, Captain.

561
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,558
我可以把你锁进地底下的单人监狱
I shall chain you in a cell underground

562
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,880
然后用警棍狠狠抽你直到你知无不言言无不尽
and take billy club to you until they pour from you like water.

563
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,680
我说的够清楚了吗
Am I clear?

564
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,200
你要这样对我吗
Am I?

565
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,200
这样对待毫无过错的我
My innocence in all this?

566
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,399
那儿还有个身中枪伤的嫌犯
There is a suspect down the way with a bullet wound,

567
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,080
需要消毒和缝补伤口
requiring disinfection and needlework.

568
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,800
你都没有试图遮掩过你的罪行么
'You make no attempt to hide your guilt.'

569
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:14,799
为什么要那么做  我不觉得那有什么见不得光的
Why should I? I feel no shame for the act.

570
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,066
那个畜生杀死了那女人 
The animal had killed the woman, 

571
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:17,678
并且还想对Lucy做同样的事
was set to do the same to Lucy.

572
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,638
换做你你也会做出跟我一样的选择 探长
I did only as you would have done, Inspector.

573
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:21,318
你觉得我会相信你么
I should take your word for that?

574
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,520
随你的便 探长  这就是真相
Take what you will, Inspector. It is the truth.

575
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:25,519
轻点儿 你这庸医
Careful, Quack!

576
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,999
真相么 就你们两个吗 
The truth, and the two of you?

577
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,174
再要找出第三个同伙可不容易   
Three unlikelier bedfellows a man would struggle to find. 

578
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:31,880
没错
Indeed.

579
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:34,239
想问什么就问吧 Reid先生
You ask your questions, Mr Reid.

580
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,458
我将会一一作答
I will answer and then

581
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:37,840
然后由你来判定我是否如实回答了
you may decide if I do so truthfully or no.

582
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,038
谁带你去的狗脖儿胡同
What brought you to Dog's Neck?

583
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,478
- Lucy   - 她邀请你去的么
- Lucy. - She invited you?

584
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,840
- 是我偷偷跟过去的  - 从哪儿开始跟的
- I followed her there. - From?

585
00:33:43,841 --> 00:33:44,960
忐忑街
Tenter Street.

586
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,319
两年来她音讯全无
Two years and not a word,

587
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,758
我甚至不清楚她是否还活着
not a solitary clue as to whether she lived or breathed.

588
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:56,080
直到有一天 她突然跑到我这儿 穿着不菲
Then, dressed fine as a lady, she knocks on my door.

589
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:57,559
她来做什么
What did she want?

590
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,999
她想重操旧业
Her old room back.

591
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,038
但你不是说她穿得很好吗
But she was dressed fine, you say?

592
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,318
我也不知道缘由 警长 可那就是事实
I have no explanation for it, Sergeant, just the fact of it.

593
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:06,278
然后你怎么跟她说的 Susan
Then what did you say to her, Susan?

594
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,640
听着 无论是否接受过良好教育
That, thoroughbred or no,

595
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:12,320
一个怀着三个月身孕的人都不可能跑这儿来接客
three months pregnant, she was no use whatsoever to your stable.

596
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,239
然后呢
Then what?

597
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,719
为什么问我
Why ask me?

598
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,439
你这么喜欢她 当时想必很懊悔吧
I imagine, being fond of her, you felt remorse.

599
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,278
于是你匆忙追赶她 还没来得及放下手中的薄荷
And you hurried after the girl, Pennyroyal in hand,

600
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:26,638
想告诉她 一旦她卸下了心理负担
to tell her that, were she to find herself free of her burden,

601
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,720
你这里仍会对她敞开门扉
she might once again be welcome.

602
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:29,760
对么
Hmm?

603
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,840
我所感兴趣的是你在那之后的见闻
But it is what you found there that interests me the most.

604
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,240
我听到她的声音从街道那头传来
I heard her from the street.

605
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,440
- 她对他大发脾气   - 对Margaret吗
- She raged at him. - Margaret?

606
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,079
是因为什么
On what topic?

607
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,798
他们扭打在一起
They were flattening the place.

608
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:51,320
他是来收房租的
He wanted his dues before they did so.

609
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:52,360
不是的
No.

610
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,079
她尖声指控着他的所作所为
She screamed of what she knew of him.

611
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,678
说她再也不会保持静默了
And that she would be silent no longer.

612
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,564
而他威胁她说
And he said that she would if

613
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:04,880
要是再不闭嘴的话 就杀了她
she knew what would allow her to keep on breathing.

614
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:06,799
我听到了玻璃碎裂的声音
I heard glass break.

615
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,680
玻璃瓶砸向他脑袋的声音吗
The bottle against his head?

616
00:35:08,681 --> 00:35:10,679
还有手枪的响声
The reports of a revolver.

617
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,999
- Lucy的尖叫声   - 然后你进去了
- Lucy screaming. - You entered.

618
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,879
Lucy当时已经歇斯底里了
Lucy was hysteric.

619
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,440
于是你拔出刀
You produced your blade.

620
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,200
从背后...
You cut...

621
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,080
捅进他的脖子
from behind.

622
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,480
之后Lucy怎么样了
And what of Lucy?

623
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,240
我把她留在那儿
I left her there.

624
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,800
在秽土和污血中蠕动着
Squirming in the dirt.

625
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,359
你瞪着我干嘛  
Why d'you stare? 

626
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,639
这已经结案了   - Reid
It is a case solved. - Reid.

627
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,918
等会儿 美国佬 快走开
No longer, American, away with ya.

628
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:05,638
Reid 你真的打算因此处她的罪吗
Reid, do you intend to charge her on this?

629
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,998
就因为救了一个女孩的性命?
For saving a girl's life?

630
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,520
但她也亲手杀了人
A man was killed by her hand.

631
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:10,639
一个死有余辜的混账畜生
A slumlord ape set on murder.

632
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,959
那也是杀人
Still a man.

633
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,640
可你怎么不想想看为什么这个人
And you never thought it worth asking why this man took

634
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,559
要把手枪对准一个弱女子
a pistol to this woman.

635
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,158
他是感受到了什么样的威胁?
Or whose threat he carried with him?

636
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,808
Jackson上校 我想
Captain Jackson, I shall be

637
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:23,558
我完全有权利处理自己得到的调查结果
the master of all enquiries I make of myself.

638
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,960
请把门关上 警长
Door, please, Sergeant.

639
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,160
你觉得有必要想这个问题么 长官
Is it worth asking? Do you think, sir?

640
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,880
是的 Bennet  我想有必要
Yes, Bennet. I suspect it is.

641
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,359
David 安静些  乖乖躺下睡觉 晚安
David, be quiet. Down and sleep. Goodnight.

642
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,400
- 晚安 阿姨   - 晚安 晚安 快睡吧
- Goodnight, Miss. - Good night, good night. Sleep!

643
00:37:04,401 --> 00:37:06,199
晚安安 做个好梦
'Go'natt. Sov Gott.

644
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,719
哦 Ellie 我找到你的洋娃娃了
Oh, Ellie, I have your dolly.

645
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,799
拿好了... 快躺好  晚安
There... tuck down. Good night.

646
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,160
快睡吧 晚安
Go to sleep. Good night.

647
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,360
哦 不
Oh, no!

648
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,920
Betsy Betsy
Betsy, Betsy.

649
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,160
Betsy  Betsy
Betsy? Betsy?

650
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,600
Goren小姐
Miss Goren?

651
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,720
似乎我总是给你带来暴力和苦痛
It seems all I bring to you is violence and distress.

652
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,280
快找到孩子们吧 求您了 探长
Find the children, please, Inspector.

653
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,879
Lucy Eames
Lucy Eames.

654
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,501
你说她在两年前就
Two years since, you say she

655
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:27,471
毫无征兆地从你那儿离开了   
walked away from your house with no warning? 

656
00:39:27,472 --> 00:39:28,398
我是这么说过
I do.

657
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,072
我想那样的话很接近
The oldest child found in that room,

658
00:39:30,073 --> 00:39:31,560
案发现场年龄大一些的孩子出生的时候
I guess she approached that age.

659
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:33,319
- 你赞同么   - 是的
- Do you agree? - Mmm.

660
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,878
那么让我来告诉你我的猜想
Then I suggest this to you.

661
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:36,097
当年你把她赶出来
That you cast her out for the

662
00:39:36,098 --> 00:39:38,198
是出于和你那天把她赶出来同样的原因
same reason you cast her out this day just passed,

663
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:42,000
那就是她怀孕了 没有办法再接客
that she was pregnant and no longer welcome in your house.

664
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,319
你觉得我铁石心肠是么 探长 
You think me callous, Inspector. 

665
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,999
或许我的确如此
And perhaps I am that.

666
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,800
但是对于那个女孩子 我像爱妹妹般爱她
But I loved that girl like a sister.

667
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,200
她从未说过她当初为何要离开
And she never did say what took her away.

668
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:07,800
但我有我的原则
But I had my theories.

669
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,159
接着说
Proceed.

670
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,030
她最初的...发作...   
The first of her... attacks... 

671
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:15,719
你是说她的痉挛吗
The fits from which she suffers?

672
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,025
那是她离开前两个月的事了  
It had come two months previous. 

673
00:40:18,026 --> 00:40:20,338
几乎把那个Thomas吓个半死 
Near scared the Thomas with whom 

674
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:21,640
就是点她的那个客人
she was engaged, to his death.

675
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:23,239
之后她还有再发作过么
There were more?

676
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,319
大概还有过五次吧 而且一次比一次严重
Perhaps five, graver too.

677
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,839
我们发现她在最后一个客人也离开她后就走了
We found her gone the day after the last one had left her.

678
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,440
我想 她或许是去接受治疗了吧
My belief? She went to find their remedy.

679
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,800
先生们 请走这边
Gentlemen, please, come this way.

680
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:22,359
在你们与她接触的治疗期间
In the treatment you conducted with her,

681
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,800
她有没有谈及过她以前生的孩子
did she speak at all of children born unto her?

682
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,080
没有
She did not.

683
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,199
也没提过她现在怀着的这个吗
Nor of the child she carries in her belly now?

684
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,912
Reid先生 我的病人们 
Mr Reid, my patients 

685
00:41:34,913 --> 00:41:37,680
无论是以前的 现在的 还是将来的...
past, present, future...

686
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,200
我没有自己的家庭 所以
I have no family of my own and as a consequence,

687
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:45,839
他们对我来说显得倍加重要
they are doubly precious to me.

688
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,599
这种感情让我无法轻视他们或是打探他们的隐私
Such love means I will not judge them nor demand their secrets.

689
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,919
他们来到这里 张开双臂请求帮助
They come to me, arms wide for assistance

690
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,599
那么我就会无差别地提供援助
and I render it without condition.

691
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,639
除非Lucy她主动来到我面前
Until Lucy chooses freely to tell me

692
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,238
向我倾诉她过往生活的一切
the details of her life away from here,

693
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:04,038
我是不会向她询问那些的
I will not ask her of them.

694
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:06,640
但同样的 我也希望你能谅解我 医生
Then that - and I hope you will forgive me for this, doctor -

695
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:08,480
这是我的职责
that must be my task.

696
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,840
Lucy
Lucy.

697
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,000
我替Susan女士问候你
I bring greetings from Miss Susan.

698
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,119
Susan女士是位淑女
Miss Susan is a lady.

699
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,119
你也是的 Lucy
As are you, Lucy.

700
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:41,079
我不是 先生 我曾经可以是
Not I, sir. I would be so.

701
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,359
但我现在不是
But am not.

702
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,119
是谁这么说的
And who is it says so?

703
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,000
是这个现世 它的法则
The world. Its law.

704
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,280
上天的法则
God's law.

705
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,240
仅仅因为你未婚先孕?
Because you have children and are unmarried?

706
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,640
有很多原因 先生
Many reasons, sir.

707
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,985
告诉我 Lucy 为什么
Tell me, Lucy, what,

708
00:43:06,986 --> 00:43:10,120
你昨天为什么要到Susan女士那儿去
what was it brought you to Miss Susan yesterday?

709
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,759
她把我送走了
Miss Susan sent me away.

710
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,319
我知道 我知道的
I know, I know.

711
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,239
但是 在两年后你怀上了孩子
But, after two years and with child inside you.

712
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,560
这令你陷入绝望
It is desperate of you.

713
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,080
告诉我 Lucy 请告诉我那个带给你绝望的人的名字
Tell me, Lucy, please, will you name that despair?

714
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,559
Lucy Lucy
Lucy? Lucy?

715
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,278
你母亲照顾的那些孩子
The children that your mother cared for,

716
00:43:36,279 --> 00:43:38,040
还有你怀着的这个孩子
the child that is inside you now.

717
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:40,919
谁是他们的父亲 Lucy
Which man is father to them, Lucy?

718
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,919
是同一个人 对么
It is but one man, is it not?

719
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,598
别害怕 孩子
Do not be frighted, child.

720
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:47,160
我会保护好你的周全
It is in my gift to guarantee your safety.

721
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,439
不 我办不到
No, no I cannot!

722
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,795
不 我办不到 办不到   
No, I cannot, I cannot, no! 

723
00:43:53,796 --> 00:43:55,680
镇定 镇定下来 孩子
Calm. Calm. Calm, child!

724
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,720
好了 都过去了
There... all right.

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,420
Eames小姐的治疗药剂  
Miss Eames' medication. 

726
00:44:46,421 --> 00:44:48,280
Reid先生想要知道它的成分
Mr Reid would know its contents.

727
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,137
Hobbs Hobbs Hobbs 慢下来 
Hobbs, Hobbs, Hobbs, slow down, 

728
00:44:59,138 --> 00:45:00,798
再说一遍 再来一遍   - 是的 长官
say again, say again. - Yes sir.

729
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,758
长官 Gordon Roach 就是那个被杀的收租人
Sir, Gordon Roach - that's the murdered rent collector, sir

730
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:07,598
拥有一家名为Roach Collections的公司   
has a company name of Roach Collections. 

731
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:08,240
挺会玩儿的
Imaginative.

732
00:45:08,241 --> 00:45:11,399
是的...诶 不对
Yes... No.

733
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,158
Roach Collections公司存入款项
Roach Collections pays into

734
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:15,096
然后收到来自信托的定期津贴   
and receives stipend from a trust. 

735
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:15,958
信托叫什么名

Fred Best跟你说过吧 他需要些东西作为报酬
Fred Best tells you he needs something shown in return.

你照我问的回答 我会给你些情报的
You do as I ask, I will

752
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:29,638
但倘若你跟他们串通一气

天堂有路你不走 地狱无门你非来

756
00:46:35,537 --> 00:46:36,679
那个秘密房东 是怎么
secret slumlord -

757
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,919
被一个老鸨的行为揭发出真面目的
is exposed by the actions of a whore-runner.

758
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,199
贪污和性丑闻 Best先生
Corruption and sex, Mr Best.

759
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,880
没有什么比这更甜美诱人的了
Surely it does not come more honeyed than that.

760
00:46:45,881 --> 00:46:47,799
哦 太好了 老天

761
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,919

你最好告诉我他去了哪

764
00:46:56,701 --> 00:46:58,320
否则我这就射死Hobbs
Or I'm going to shoot Hobbs here.

765
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,078
放轻松 Hobbs  老兄 我是开玩笑的
Relax, Hobbs. Man, I'm only joking.

766
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,600
就算我开枪杀了我妈 也不会杀了你的
I could no more shoot you than I could shoot my own mother.

767
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:08,080
Artherton 就另当别论了...
Artherton, on the other hand...

768
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,999
如你所知 探长
As you know, Inspector,

769
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,358
他是新郡议会在一月份任命的第一批议员之一
he was one of the first raised up in January by our new council.

770
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:16,958
现在三月份他和他的朋友们对
Now in March he and his friends agree that the Dockhead slum

771
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,361
清拆萨瑟克区的坞首贫民窟
in Southwark make way for

772
00:47:18,362 --> 00:47:20,718
以修建S&C铁路和它的第一条隧道的议案表示支持
the S&C Railway and its very first tunnel.

773
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:22,020
坞首地区属于
The Dockhead was also owned

774
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:24,238
- Stickleton信托吗   - 是的
- and collected by the Stickleton Trust? - It was.

775
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,240
因此Bone先生实际上是支持了强制收购自己的贫民窟
Thus Mr Bone recommends the compulsory purchase of his own slum.

776
00:47:27,241 --> 00:47:29,079
嗯哼 而且收益颇丰
Mm-hm and profits tidily.

777
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,078
Best先生 我上次见到你时
Mr Best, the last I saw you, you made heavy weather of matters

778

你对Bone的私人情况发表了长篇大论
that relate more closely to Mr Bone's personal status.

779
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:36,657
是的 我说的都是事实   
I did. It is true. 

780
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:38,079
你可以详细阐述一下吗
Elaborate, if you please?

781
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,519
Bone先生并非生来就野心勃勃
Mr Bone is a man who came to ambition late.

782
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,680
他的童年并不幸福 被痉挛所困扰
His youth was not a happy one. Beset with fits.

783
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,439
他是癫痫患者?
He is epileptic?

784
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,001
曾经是 他最后治好了
Was. He eventually found the cure.

785
00:47:49,002 --> 00:47:50,518
治愈了?  治疗方法从何而来?
And the cure? Where was it found?

786
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:53,520
你要么让我过去 要么就尝尝子弹的滋味吧
You will let me pass, or you will suck on this iron!

787
00:47:53,521 --> 00:47:55,920
先生 停下  你不能进去
Sir, stop! You can't go in there!

788
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,440
Drake
Drake.

789
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,195
听着 我发誓我不会杀你 
Look, I swear I'm not going to shoot you, 

790
00:48:04,196 --> 00:48:07,240
只要... 告诉Reid...
only... tell Reid...

791
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:13,079
那个药瓶...Lucy的药物...额...
that the vial... Lucy's medication... Uh...

792
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,079
什么  那是什么
What? What is it?

793
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,800
那是苯丙胺
It is amphetamine!

794
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,800

给Bone先生治疗的医生
The doctor who gave Mr Bone his cure.

796
00:48:24,399 --> 00:48:27,158
- 他叫Crabbe 是不是   - 是的 Reid先生
- His name is Crabbe, is it not? - It is, Mr Reid.

797
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:28,836
我们走  啊 最后一个问题
We go. Ah, one last question.

798
00:48:28,837 --> 00:48:30,918
你嘲讽过他的单身状态
You jibed about his bachelor status.

799
00:48:30,919 --> 00:48:32,040
你为什么要笑他
What did you mean by this?

800
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:35,199
这是最后一个关键点 Reid先生
That is the last piece of my puzzle, Mr Reid.

801
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,038
据说他在外面藏了个情妇
There was tell he had a woman cached away somewhere

802
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:39,478
还有一些私生子
and a set of bastards, too

803
00:48:39,479 --> 00:48:40,560
你找到他们了吗
And did you find them?

804
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:43,879
没有 Reid先生 这是遗憾之处 嗯?
Never could, Mr Reid. More's the pity, eh?

805
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,280
确实
Indeed.

806
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,920
你的马车到了
Your carriage is here.

807
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,214
这马车将带你去收获这个城市里
A carriage that takes you to honour the

808
00:48:59,215 --> 00:49:03,880
又一段值得庆祝的荣耀
latest chapter of your ever more celebrated life in this city.

809
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,480
想一想
Think on that.

810
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,120
还记得你第一次来见我是怎样的吗
Remember how you lived the first you came to me -

811
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:18,839
被痉挛所折磨 依赖着你残忍的妻子苟活着
cursed by fits and reliance on your merciless wife.

812
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,197
你觉得我忘却了吗
Do you think I forget?

813
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:23,160
难道我没有对你为我做的一切感怀于心吗
Am I not grateful for what you have done for me?

814
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:27,679
我怀疑你是否对我们面前存在的阻碍有所行动
I question your commitment to all that still lies ahead of us.

815
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,239
Roach杀了那个女人
Roach silenced the woman.

816
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,724
我与孩子们分离
I have had the children separated

817
00:49:31,725 --> 00:49:34,198
不远百里来到这儿 听从了你的建议
and removed a hundred mile from here, as you suggested.

818
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:37,239
我指的并不是你那些不受宠爱的私生子们 
I do not refer to your unloved bastards, 

819
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:37,880
这你知道
as you well know.

820
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:45,639
能成功建起这个疗养院 你功不可没
It was your success had this sanatorium built,

821
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,959
而她就是我对你的回礼
and she my gift to you in return.

822
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,680
一个孩子 逐渐盛开为成熟女人 她所目见的
A child, blooming into woman, who would see in you

823
00:49:51,681 --> 00:49:55,799
并不是年轻时口吃而癫狂的你
not the stammering lunatic of your youth,

824
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,480
而是一个充满希望和力量的你
but a vision of strength and hope.

825
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,320
你已经享受过她给你带来的满足
You have enjoyed her.

826
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,519
可她现在已经没有用处了
But she is all used now.

827
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,800
而且必须把她对你所有的记忆通通抹去
And must have her mind cleaned of all she knows of you.

828
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,719
但她还如此年轻...
But she is so young...

829
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,919
也许她也能和我一样在你引领下找寻到救赎
She too may find the temperance you have led me toward.

830
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,774
不 她的成长历程比你更糟糕 
No. She grows ever more disturbed. 

831
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:28,159
而且那个Reid已经让一切失去了可能
And this Reid draws close.

832
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,944
我绝对不会允许你
I will not allow you to

833
00:50:29,945 --> 00:50:33,359
毁了我为你筑造出的人生
make ruins of the life I have built for you.

834
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,959
她必须就此沉默 快点忘记她吧
She must be silenced so put her from your mind,

835
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,640
就像忘记你记忆中曾经的自己
as you have the memory of the man you once were.

836
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:47,880
然后让我赐予她永恒的安宁
And leave me to bring her a more permanent peace.

837
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,040
Karl 我会去和她告别的
Karl, I would say goodbye.

838
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,200
谢谢你 护士
Thank you, nurse.

只说你应该说的
Say what you need to say.

841

再见 Lucy 再见 我的爱
Goodbye, Lucy, goodbye, my love.

842
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,639
Stanley  Stanley 他们要把我带到哪儿去
Stanley? Stanley, where do they take me?

843
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,126
我...我又有宝宝了 Stanley 
I... I've got another inside me, Stanley, 

844
00:51:41,127 --> 00:51:43,879
又有个宝宝了 Stanley?
I got another. Stanley?

845
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,759
没事的 Bone议员
It's all right, Councillor Bone.

846
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,199
只有拆除一两个贫民窟才能建成铁路
We cannot build a railway without that we demolish a slum or two.

847
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,240
Sta...
Sta...

848
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,799
等等  那是Bone
Wait. That was Bone!

849
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,480
暂且不管  我走我们的
It can wait. We keep our course.

850
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:26,520
安静 Lucy  嘘 想象一下
Hush, Lucy. Shh, imagine it.

一切平静至极  没有疑虑 没有烦扰

归于平静
Simply peace.

854

你找到我们了
You found us.

855
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,558
这可不容易  你把避难所藏得太好了
It was not easy. You've hidden this refuge well.

856
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:22,360
但对你保护下的人们来说是件好事
But that is a benefit to those you house.

857
00:53:22,361 --> 00:53:24,160

还将在这片土地上继续有所作为

女士们 先生们 这将是一个崭新的城市的根基

875
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:31,478
这个城市会如同明媚的夏日清晨般熠熠生辉

878
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,360
有必要 探长
I do, Inspector.

879
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,880
H警区的Reid探长 您来这有何贵干
H Division's Inspector Reid! What intrusion is this?

880
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,200
是的 Stanley 我仍旧拥有理智
Yes, Stanley. I still have my wits.

881
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,078
女士 女士  你叫什么名字
Miss, Miss. What is your name?

882
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,680
她的名字并不重要  重要的是她的故事
Her name is not relevant. Her story is.

883
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,960
我对你知根知底 Stanley Bone
I know you, Stanley Bone.

884
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,126
你向这些好人宣告
You proclaim to these

885
00:55:33,127 --> 00:55:36,999
言辞中充满对未来的光明的希望
good people about the future's gleaming hope,

886
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,359
但说出这些话语的你却是虚伪的
but the tongue you speak with is forked.

887
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,141
以及你所描绘的未来 
And the future you speak of, 

888
00:55:43,142 --> 00:55:45,280
实则建立于邪恶与腐败之上
it is built on evil and corruption.

889
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,519
你把我当做你的奴隶 
You had me as your slave, 

890
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,479
拒绝我们的孩子...
denied our children...

891
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,279
放任我母亲被杀害 
had my mother murdered 

892
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,522
你还把我送到一个活生生的地狱
and you would have

893
00:55:53,523 --> 00:55:55,352
倘若不是有这位探长的存在 
sent me to a living hell 

894
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:56,760
我恐怕至今也无法走出
had it not been for this inspector here.

895
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,999
你简直不是人 你就是一个
You are no man, but you are a beast that has risen

896
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,240
从你所深挖的地下世界中长大的牲畜
deep from the earth in which you dig into.

897
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,480
Stanley Bone先生
Mr Stanley Bone!

898
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,960
你去阻止警察
You halt for the police!

899
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,040
你们小心 远离轨道  谁快点去关了它
Watch yourself, off the track. Turn it off, somebody!

900
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,160
我的天哪
Christ alive!

901
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,859
你出名了
You're famous. From a

902
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:11,759
从莱曼街的监狱到今天的头版头条
Leman Street cell to the front page in a day.

903
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,239
一定会有人为你着迷
Someone must be fond of you.

904
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,919
哼 这种名誉是暂时的
Hmm, such fame is impermanent.

905
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,559
最好如此  否则
You'd better hope so. Otherwise,

906
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,120
无法继续生存下去的就会是你我二人
it's going to be you and me lacking in permanence.

907
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,400
我们需要对付的一定不是普通的盗贼
Whoever we contend with here, they are no ordinary cracksmen.

908
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,559
再来
Again!

909
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,366
法律面前人人平等 他们不是吗   
All men stand equal before the law, do they not? 

910
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:46,400
这就是法律
That is the law.

911
00:57:46,401 --> 00:57:48,560
这是你的法律 是你的吗
It is your law. Is it yours?
