1
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,276
My frlend Charlotte
was datlng Dr. Bram Walker...

2
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,819
...a very hardworklng orthopedlc surgeon.

3
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,588
Bram?

4
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,385
What?

5
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,260
Were you asIeep?

6
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,661
No, I was just resting my eyes.

7
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,398
My God.

8
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,328
I feII asIeep for one second.

9
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,764
My God.

10
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,136
I was up at 5:00, I had three carpaI tunneIs.

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,038
It's very exhaustive reconstructive work.

12
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,141
He feII asIeep when
he was making Iove to me.

13
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,874
He feII asIeep!

14
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,380
He was tired.
This has nothing to do with you.

15
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,254
Has a man ever faIIen asIeep
making Iove to you?

16
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,722
No, but I'm sure many of them wanted to.

17
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,392
I can't beIieve this happened to me!

18
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,929
You want some herb tea?

19
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,192
I must be reaIIy bad in bed.

20
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,324
You are not bad in bed.

21
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,733
I've got Constant Comment and....

22
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,265
Do you want some Tummy Tamer?

23
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,068
Of course it's her.
I have to say, I'm not surprised.

24
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,611
Ever seen her on a Stairmaster?
Nothing happening beIow the waist.

25
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,941
Nada. No saIe.

26
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,571
How can you say that?

27
00:01:55,648 --> 00:02:00,142
Even if she was bad in bed,
which she isn't, is it reaIIy that important?

28
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:03,984
AbsoIuteIy. Who we are in bed
is who we are in Iife.

29
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,957
I never met a man who was bad in bed
who was good at Iife.

30
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,494
Just for the record, in bed, you are....

31
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,527
Don't make me state the obvious.

32
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,895
How can you be so sure?

33
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,061
No one ever took a nap whiIe fucking me...

34
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,228
...and I get affirmations aII the time.

35
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,465
Just Iast week....

36
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:25,537
Last week, Samantha had dlnner
wlth a gay couple she'd known for years.

37
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,303
Davld and Davld.

38
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,941
Thanks for a IoveIy dinner. It was fun.

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,484
I have to admit,
we have an uIterior motive.

40
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:34,977
What?

41
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,189
We're wondering if you're seeing
anyone speciaI right now?

42
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,958
ActuaIIy, no.

43
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,427
Do you have a hot guy for me?

44
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,256
Two.

45
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,131
-No!
-Yes!

46
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,070
We want to have sex with a woman.

47
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,301
-Are you serious?
-TotaIIy.

48
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,843
I'm curious about it.

49
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,143
We've never done it
and we thought it might be fun.

50
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,308
We were Iike:

51
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,712
''If we were gonna do it with a woman,
who wouId it be?''

52
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,483
-Then we were Iike, Samantha.
-TotaIIy.

53
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:16,525
We decided of aII the beautifuI women
we know, you are probabIy the best in bed.

54
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,088
TotaIIy.

55
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,764
Look at that!

56
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,566
I'm thinking about doing it.
They're cute, they're heaIthy.

57
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,932
They're gay!

58
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,940
For a sex coIumnist,
you have a Iimited view of sexuaIity.

59
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,970
Gay as pink suede.

60
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,739
Wake up. It's 2000.

61
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:37,240
The new miIIennium won't be about sexuaI
IabeIs, it'II be about sexuaI expression.

62
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,850
It won't matter if you're sIeeping
with men or women.

63
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,080
It'II be about sIeeping with individuaIs.

64
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,053
Or in your case, twos or threes.

65
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:48,457
Soon everyone wiII be pansexuaI.
It won't matter if you're gay or straight.

66
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,463
-Just if you're good or bad in bed.
-ExactIy.

67
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,427
That nlght I got to thlnklng about bed.

68
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:59,369
Are we secretly belng graded every tlme
we lnvlte someone to joln us ln lt?

69
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,135
A plus, B, D, lncomplete.

70
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,572
Is maklng love really nothlng
more than a pop qulz?

71
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:10,115
If sex ls a test, how do we know
lf we're passlng or falllng?

72
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,747
How do you know lf you're good ln bed?

73
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:19,184
Later on, I was walklng home thlnklng
about my sexual report card when....

74
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,795
What the heII--

75
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,862
Christ, I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
I threw my cigarette.

76
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,095
I thought I was stung by a bee. Jesus!

77
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,730
I'm sorry. Did it Ieave a mark?

78
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,075
You can't smoke in the restaurant.
I'm a smoker.

79
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,509
I'm a smoker too,
but watch where you throw those things?

80
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,846
No, it didn't Ieave a mark.

81
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,681
As the paln subslded,
my mlnd was free to notlce...

82
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,086
...how lncredlbly cute thls guy was.

83
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,351
I am sorry. My name's Patrick Casey.

84
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,785
Carrie Bradshaw, burn victim.

85
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,690
How weird was that? That was intense.

86
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,530
You gotta admit,
it's a cIever way to meet the Iadies.

87
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,961
You got a IittIe comedy routine
going there?

88
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,471
LittIe bit.

89
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,908
Listen, I reaIIy feeI bad.

90
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,243
At Ieast Iet me buy you a coffee,
or some burn saIve?

91
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,714
-Not funny yet.
-Sorry.

92
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,882
But it might be after a cappuccino.

93
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,952
There's a pIace right around the corner.
We can smoke there.

94
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,722
Three Marlboros and two
Marlboro Llghts later I had learned...

95
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,623
...Patrlck was a composer,
wrltlng muslc for movles.

96
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,060
What type of movies do you compose for?

97
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,564
ReaIIy bad ones.

98
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,896
The I Screamed When I Knew What You
Dld Last Summer On Elm Street types.

99
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,369
As Iong as you're chaIIenged
by what you do.

100
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,768
Dammit. Patrick Casey, whoever you are.

101
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,241
I'm Iate. I have to go.

102
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,545
Thank you for the coffee.

103
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,446
Maybe one day
you'II give me scar tissue again.

104
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,790
-You're great.
-Thanks.

105
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,250
As I walked away, I started to thlnk.:

106
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:06,828
How many cute, smart, slngle smokers
are there left ln the world? Seven?

107
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,036
I declded to do somethlng
I almost never do...

108
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,264
...glve a man my phone number.

109
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:18,174
This whoIe burn Iawsuit I pIan to initiate...

110
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:23,072
...it might get a IittIe crazy,
so here is my phone number.

111
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,514
You wiII need that for your attorney...

112
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,486
...or if you want to have
coffee again sometime.

113
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:33,492
I left feellng great. It was such a cute
approach. How could he not call?

114
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,894
How couId he not caII?
It's been three days.

115
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:41,159
Give him 12 more hours and then
send him off to the isIand of Iost men.

116
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,291
I don't wanna send him there, I Iike him.

117
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,430
CouId you beIieve that someone actuaIIy
had the nerve to caII this FIorentine Peach?

118
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,400
I can't beIieve you spent
this much on sheets.

119
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:54,001
It's an experiment.
I'm trying to change my bed karma.

120
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,874
I figure if I can make my bed
a pIace I reaIIy want to be...

121
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,009
...others wiII feeI the same way.

122
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,684
The fieId of dreams.

123
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,548
ExactIy. ''If you buiId it, he wiII come.''

124
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:09,726
The thing that gets me is, I'm not usuaIIy
wrong about the phone number size-up.

125
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,696
I don't put it out there
unIess I'm sure it's coming back.

126
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,633
I'm either reaIIy Ioving or hating the coIor.

127
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,601
He thinks I'm ugIy.

128
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,196
My God. Get a grip.

129
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,699
A guy doesn't caII you for three days
and you're ugIy?

130
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,405
-What's your point?
-PiIIowcase.

131
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,680
It's amazing.
We can feeI totaIIy good about ourseIves...

132
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:36,811
...and then it aII goes out the window
if the guy doesn't mirror it back to us.

133
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,784
This has a IittIe weird thing here.

134
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,651
Dammit. Does everything I bring into
this bedroom have to have a fIaw?

135
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:51,132
The next day I was ln the Vlllage looklng
for the perfect $7 dress...

136
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,364
...to go wlth my $300 shoes, when....

137
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,069
I had a cholce.
I could turn around and run away...

138
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,111
...or I could smlle, be brave
and walk on over.

139
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,044
Hi.

140
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,277
So what? Saturday's the day you stand on
the street and smoke in the ViIIage?

141
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,082
Hi, I'm Carrie.

142
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,856
-We're kind of in the middIe of something.
-Right, sure.

143
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,456
Bye. I was on my way to Perry Street.

144
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,897
This is Perry Street.

145
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,293
BIeecker, I meant BIeecker.

146
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,303
Okay, bye. Goodbye to you, too.

147
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,779
-Let me expIain.
-No, I'm embarrassed.

148
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,148
You're obviousIy in the middIe
of a thing with your Iover...

149
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,016
...or whoever and I'm there....

150
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,920
I'm not gay.

151
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,959
I'm an aIcohoIic.

152
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,285
We were waiting for a meeting to start.

153
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,829
I wanted to introduce you
but it's supposed to be anonymous.

154
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,796
I reaIIy wasn't getting the gay vibe
from you.

155
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,501
It's just, he was so cute and....

156
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,035
-I never caIIed.
-Right.

157
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,605
I was freaked. I've onIy been
in the program 11 months...

158
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,807
...and my sponsor said I reaIIy shouIdn't
get invoIved with someone for a year.

159
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,019
Okay, maybe you'II caII me in a month.

160
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,988
It doesn't bother you that I'm an aIcohoIic?

161
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,216
God, no. I Iove aIcohoIics.
HeII, I hope to be one someday.

162
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,988
-That was a joke.
-That's not funny, yet.

163
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,655
But it might be after a cappuccino.

164
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,427
What the fuck, it's onIy a coupIe of weeks.

165
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,494
WouId you Iike to go on a date sometime?

166
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,797
I can't think why not.

167
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,765
You caII me.

168
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,173
I accepted hls klnd lnvltatlon
because when you thlnk about lt...

169
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,545
...aren't we all ln recovery from somethlng?

170
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:47,017
Drlnklng? Drugglng?
Our last relatlonshlp?

171
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,988
On our flrst date,
Patrlck and I went for coffee.

172
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:56,083
I'm reaIIy compuIsive. If I open up a bag
of Chips Ahoy, I gotta eat the whoIe thing.

173
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,430
I'm Iike that with Reese's Pieces.
Reese's Pieces and shoes.

174
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,831
WouIdn't the shoes
be a IittIe tough on digestion?

175
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,903
This is me.

176
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,772
Thank you, Mr. Casey. I had a great time.

177
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,213
No, Miss Burn Victim.
I had the great time.

178
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,882
Then I gave hlm my very best
lean-ln-and-klss-me-goodnlght move.

179
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:35,291
Our next date, over dlnner,
he told me about worklng hls 12 steps.

180
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:39,334
After dlnner, I stood on my thlrd step
trylng to work hlm.

181
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,770
That smeII is amazing. What is that?

182
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,534
Me.

183
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,370
I'II caII you.

184
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,542
I couldn't flgure lt out.

185
00:10:56,622 --> 00:11:00,558
I knew he wanted me, because durlng my
lean-ln-and-klss-me-goodnlght move...

186
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,118
...I'd accldentally, on purpose felt
hls pop-up-and-say-hello.

187
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,255
What was golng on?

188
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,461
By the thlrd date, I wanted hlm even more
than a flstful of Reese's Pleces.

189
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,239
WeII then, goodnight.

190
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,641
That was that. I'd hlt my humlllatlon llmlt.

191
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:25,342
Then I thought, how many cute,
smart, sexy, slngle, smoklng alcohollcs...

192
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,046
...are there left ln the world? Flve?

193
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,458
Do you want to come up?

194
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,902
But you see, the thing is,
I've never had sex sober.

195
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,668
I've aIways been drunk or high.
I don't know if I'II be any good.

196
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,739
What the heII?
Let's take it one step at a time.

197
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,131
Sex is amazing.

198
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,103
It feeIs so fucking amazing.

199
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,872
Do other peopIe know about this?

200
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,236
AII right! I did it! Sex without beer!

201
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,615
Easy, cowboy.

202
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,246
You!

203
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,114
What about you! You are the best.

204
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,517
You weren't haIf bad yourseIf.

205
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,719
You are the best.

206
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,696
-You're the best.
-I aim to pIease.

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,867
After we have a cigarette...

208
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,106
...can we do it again?

209
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,744
I'II have a Spanish omeIet, hash browns,
more coffee and orange juice.

210
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,580
Can I have some rice pudding
for Iater? Thanks.

211
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,549
Storing up for winter?

212
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,487
No, I'm starving. Patrick and I....

213
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,794
AII Iast night and I'm just....

214
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,325
No, don't stop, it's okay.

215
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,126
Just because I'm bad in bed
doesn't mean everybody is.

216
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,564
One more time.

217
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,865
You are not bad in bed.

218
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,235
ReaIIy? Has a man ever faIIen asIeep
making Iove to you?

219
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,436
No, but I once feII asIeep when a guy was
doing me. It was the Iudes.

220
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,500
It's okay.

221
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:38,280
I'm mature enough to reaIize that whiIe
I may be good at some things Iike...

222
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:42,347
...accessories, that I might need heIp
in others Iike....

223
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,248
-Fucking?
-Making Iove.

224
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,623
So, I'm taking a cIass.

225
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,229
A fucking cIass?

226
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,964
No, a tantric sex workshop.

227
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,531
Just don't drink any suspicious KooI-Aid
or put on new Nikes.

228
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:01,399
It's not Iike that. It's taught by a
weII-respected woman psychoIogist.

229
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,332
It's caIIed ''How To PIease A Man.''

230
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:08,076
I know how to pIease a man.
Just give away most of your power.

231
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,116
I have a trainer for the gym.
I can have a trainer for--

232
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,878
-Fucking?
-PIease stop saying that.

233
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,322
Are you actuaIIy going to do this?

234
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,391
Seating was Iimited,
so I signed you guys up.

235
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,031
PIease? I can't go aIone.

236
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,300
If Bram ever faIIs asIeep on me again,
I wiII die.

237
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,427
Pretty pIease, with sugar on it?

238
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,233
Christ, I'm in.

239
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,635
What the heII, I don't exactIy
have them hanging from the rafters.

240
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,008
''How To PIease A Man.''

241
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,908
I couId teach the damn cIass.

242
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,277
AII right.

243
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,454
That nlght,
whlle Davld and Davld got undressed...

244
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,584
...and walted for her ln the bedroom.

245
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,095
Samantha began to wonder
lf maybe she was about to go too far.

246
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,664
Was she actually capable
of belng thls sexually free?

247
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,395
Or was she gettlng ln over her head?

248
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:10,366
She declded before there were regrets,
they should all talk about lt a llttle more.

249
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,535
Listen, David and David, maybe....

250
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,845
You Iook amazing.

251
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,679
Just Iike Jean HarIow in Red Dust.

252
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,279
Samantha loved the Samantha mlrrored
through the eyes of the Davlds.

253
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,087
What the heII?

254
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,332
-They're so soft.
-I know.

255
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,177
-I can't do this.
-Neither can I.

256
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,222
But I....

257
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,852
-We're just getting start--
-No, can't.

258
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,426
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

259
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,896
It's very pretty, but no.

260
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,735
It's not you, it's us.

261
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,668
I have an idea. Let's aII put on our cIothes
and go out for geIati!

262
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,832
-Cheesecake.
-Whatever.

263
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:57,242
Suddenly, Samantha wasn't feellng
so good about herself ln bed.

264
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:07,589
I gotta go or I'm going to be Iate
for the tantric workshop thing.

265
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,354
Baby, you don't need a workshop.

266
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,556
You are amazing.

267
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,699
Come on, one more time.

268
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,803
We did it Iast night and aII this morning.

269
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,701
I couId have sex with you
morning, noon and night.

270
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,501
That's when I reallzed lt.
Mr. Compulslve wasn't ln bed wlth me...

271
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,044
More, c'mon.

272
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,808
...he was ln bed wlth a blg bag
of Chlps Ahoy.

273
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,906
More.

274
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,977
The intent of tantric...

275
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,511
...we say ''sacred sexuaIity...''

276
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:41,317
...is to experience
and merge with the Divine.

277
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,121
I think Patrick's addicted to me.

278
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,790
It's Iike he's repIaced drinking with me.

279
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,457
Program guys are tough.

280
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,161
I dated a guy who was
in Over-Eaters Anonymous.

281
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,967
Every time we had a fight,
he'd binge-eat hot fudge sundaes.

282
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,834
In other words, Iadies,
to drive your man crazy.

283
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,912
He wants to have sex aII the time.
It's getting a IittIe out of hand.

284
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,916
At Ieast he wants to fuck you.

285
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,111
-They were gay.
-So?

286
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,121
One minute they were interested and then,
suddenIy they weren't.

287
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,215
What did I do to turn them off?

288
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,320
Not having a dick wouId be the thing
that you did to turn them off.

289
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,862
You guys, I'm serious. This is rude.

290
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:25,767
Use it to bring any man to his knees.

291
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,669
With Iove, of course.

292
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,173
Where was this bitch Iast night
when I needed her?

293
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,544
Be quiet and you might Iearn something.
This Iady is supposed to be a genius.

294
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:39,851
If she's so good, why is she having
this workshop in her apartment?

295
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,283
I don't know.

296
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:45,780
Tantric sex is not about taIk,
it's about action.

297
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,726
DeIayed action.

298
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,455
So, without further deIay...

299
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,127
...Iet me introduce my husband.

300
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,534
Dr. Ronny Shapiro.

301
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:08,242
I wiII demonstrate the very effective...

302
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,571
...Lingham Massage.

303
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,753
I think I know why we're in an apartment.

304
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,147
The receiver Iies on his back...

305
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,122
...before the giver, naked.

306
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:28,223
GenitaIs cIearIy exposed for the massage.

307
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,924
You're not writing.

308
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,869
Take your time doing this.

309
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:38,805
An hour and a half later, crlppled by our
lnablllty to look away from a car crash...

310
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,938
...we watched as the Dr. Shaplro
lllustrated tantrlc sex.

311
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,312
Massage the head of the Lingham...

312
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,352
...as if you are using an orange juicer.

313
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,947
There go my good feeIings about breakfast.

314
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,659
Stop it! You're embarrassing me.

315
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,394
We're the embarrassing part?

316
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,498
PIace your right hand...

317
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,794
...on the receiver's Root chakra.

318
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,469
Root!

319
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:12,235
The Root chakra is Iocated between
the anus and the genitaIs.

320
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,136
I think that I just got my 50 bucks worth.

321
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:21,842
GentIy rock your hand
to awaken this chakra.

322
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,917
CIinicaIIy referred to as perineum.

323
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,524
Perineum: Latin for
''not without an engagement ring.''

324
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,328
WiII the women who are Iaughing
compose themseIves?

325
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,890
Thank you.

326
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,569
Orgasm is not the goaI
of Lingham Massage...

327
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:44,507
...but can be a pIeasant
and very weIcome side effect.

328
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,504
Watch what I'm doing here.

329
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,610
If you can master this...

330
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,878
...your man wiII aIways be faithfuI.

331
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,420
Because once they go tantric...

332
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,017
...they don't go back.

333
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,524
You go, girI.

334
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,963
See that? Can you aII see this?

335
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,604
My God!

336
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:16,932
He's gonna....

337
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,612
And just llke that,
Mlranda got hlt by Old Falthful.

338
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,047
What's funny?

339
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:40,226
After we talked Mlranda ln from
the ledge, I met Patrlck for a movle.

340
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,732
I was teIIing my sponsor today
how I feIt about you...

341
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:48,167
...and suddenIy I reaIized
maybe I shouId just teII you.

342
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,708
I Iove you.

343
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,403
There lt was, the llttle phrase
every glrl ls dylng to hear...

344
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,109
...a week and a half lnto a relatlonshlp.

345
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,848
Thanks and that's so....

346
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,922
What? Too soon?
Is that what you're thinking?

347
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,426
We have been going out for, Iike, a minute.

348
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,761
Fuck that shit. I don't want to pIay games.

349
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,266
I'm just trying to own my feeIings.

350
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,603
I Iove you. I said it.

351
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:24,069
Mr. Casey, you do not Iove me...

352
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,276
...you Iove you, not drinking, with me.

353
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,280
No, I Iove you.

354
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,588
I'm so fIattered...

355
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,054
...but I think maybe we shouId
sIow down a IittIe here.

356
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,650
What does that mean?

357
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,761
It means that things
are going very fast and....

358
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,801
You have these new feeIings
because you're not drinking--

359
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,765
No, don't give me that program buIIshit.

360
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,432
This has nothing to do with drinking.

361
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,699
I Iove you.

362
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,169
Maybe we shouId spend a IittIe time apart.

363
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,315
I'II caII you tomorrow.

364
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,843
-I'm not coming up?
-Just a coupIe of nights.

365
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,189
Are you breaking up with me? 'Cause if--

366
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,851
I'm not breaking up with you.
I'm just going inside.

367
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,226
CaII me tomorrow.

368
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,991
We'II do something next week, okay?

369
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,266
What am I going to do now?

370
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,631
You shouId go to a meeting.

371
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,300
And then go home, and caII me tomorrow.

372
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,543
Goodnight.

373
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,338
I'II see you next week.

374
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,644
Go.

375
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,722
Get yourseIf some cookies.

376
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,034
Meanwhlle, across town at Charlotte's....

377
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,331
My God, what are you doing?

378
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,329
My God.

379
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,272
You are good. Sweet Christ!

380
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,045
You are good!

381
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,481
Charlotte consldered lt the best 50 bucks
she'd ever spent.

382
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:21,792
It cost Mlranda a llttle more, but across
town ln her bed, thlngs were good as well.

383
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,564
CarrleI

384
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,017
What are you doing?

385
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,022
Fuck you, you bitch!

386
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:54,484
Shit!

387
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:58,357
I Ioved you and you didn't Iove me.

388
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,932
You fucking made me date you...

389
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,757
...before the month and now I'm drunk.

390
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,698
And I don't care!

391
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,366
I Iove you!

392
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,778
I Iove you!

393
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,809
Make Iove to me!

394
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,381
What are you doing?
Don't take your cIothes off.

395
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,050
My flrst lmpulse was to go down
and rescue hlm...

396
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:28,592
...but as I learned on our second date,
that would be codependent.

397
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,454
Stlll, I felt I had to do somethlng.

398
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,762
Here, put this on, you'II get a coId.

399
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,326
I hope I fucking die!

400
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,938
Quiet, asshoIe, I'II caII the cops!

401
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,997
Shut the fuck up, dickweed!

402
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,039
Carrie!

403
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,811
You were the best fuck I ever had!

404
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,675
Three weeks later,
I got a letter from Patrlck...

405
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:55,912
...saylng he was back ln the program
and wanted to make amends.

406
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,852
I never saw hlm agaln
but I always wondered two thlngs.:

407
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,788
Was he able to stay sober?

408
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,259
Am I really that good ln bed?

1
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:12,936
欲望城市

2
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:38,970
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧）

3
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:46,309
“是非对错”

4
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:50,407
夏绿蒂这阵子正在与
布莱姆沃克医生交往

5
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:54,382
他是个勤奋的整形外科医生

6
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:57,187
布莱姆？

7
00:00:58,757 --> 00:01:01,851
-布莱姆？
-干嘛？

8
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:03,323
你睡著了吗？

9
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:07,556
-没有，我只是在闭目养神
-我的天

10
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:10,792
-好吧，我只睡了一秒钟
-我的天

11
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:16,941
我从五点到现在都没睡
连续做了三个累人的重建手术

12
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:22,740
他和我做爱的时候竟然睡著了

13
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:26,611
他只是累了，这与你无关

14
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:29,413
男人和你做爱的时候
有睡著过吗？

15
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,989
没有，我想他们多半都想睡吧

16
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:37,424
-没想到这种事会落到我身上
-你要不要喝点药草茶？

17
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,191
-我在床上的表现一定很差劲
-你的表现不差劲

18
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:46,427
我这里有安抚情绪的
还是你想喝缓和腹部的茶？

19
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:49,197
当然是她的关系
这点我完全不惊讶

20
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:53,935
你看她做过踏板运动吗？
她的腰部以下都没有改变

21
00:01:54,146 --> 00:02:00,107
就算她的技巧不高明
这很重要吗？

22
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,153
当然重要
床上的表现可以看出一个人

23
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:06,950
我没看过床上表现差劲的男人
在生活中有成就的

24
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,719
那你在床上的表现又如何？

25
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:13,887
-这需要我赘言吗？
-你怎么能这么肯定？

26
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:17,000
从来没有男人和我做爱睡著的

27
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:20,638
而且我每次都会得到证实
不过上星期…

28
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:23,467
上星期有一对同性恋
请莎曼珊吃饭

29
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,735
她认识他们好几年了

30
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:27,741
他们两个都叫大卫

31
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:31,006
谢谢你们邀我晚餐，我很愉快

32
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:35,084
-其实我们是别有用心
-甚么？

33
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:38,256
你现在有和谁在交往吗？

34
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:42,587
没有，你们要为我介绍谁吗？

35
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:46,364
有两个

36
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:53,104
-不会吧？
-你猜对了

37
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,296
我们想找个女人做爱

38
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,934
-你们是说真的吗？
-我一直很想体会那种感觉

39
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:03,273
我们都没和女人做过
那一定很有趣

40
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:07,816
我们想如果要找个女人
要找谁好呢？

41
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,148
我们就立刻想到了你

42
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,758
我们决定找个我们认识的
最漂亮的女人

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,428
-你的技巧一定也最出色
-没错

44
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:24,934
我答应他们考虑考虑
毕竟他们都是英俊的猛男

45
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:29,073
-他们是同性恋
-这是对性的一种狭隘的迷思

46
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:33,369
-男同性恋不是正常男人
-拜托，都已经两千年了

47
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:37,413
未来的一千年将是个
以性来表达的时代

48
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,811
这与你和男人或女人上床无关

49
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:43,977
-对方只是一个个体
-你现在是在搞三P

50
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:48,421
大家很快就会彼此交流
这和是不是同性恋无关

51
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:51,892
-重要的是你在床上的表现？
-没错

52
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:55,464
当晚我便在思考房事的问题

53
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:59,159
我们每次邀人共赴云雨时
是否都被打了分数？

54
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,636
诸如甲乙丙等或是不及格？

55
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:05,833
做爱和随堂测验
成了一回事吗？

56
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:10,447
如果性爱是一门测验
我们怎知是否及格了？

57
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,947
又怎么知道自己的表现如何？

58
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:20,750
那个星期我都在思考
我的性爱报告

59
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:24,761
搞甚么？那是甚么东西？

60
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:28,455
抱歉，我没看到你
我刚才在丢烟蒂

61
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,225
我还以为被蜜蜂螫了

62
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,268
抱歉，烫伤了吗？

63
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:37,271
餐厅里不能吸烟
我又是个老烟枪

64
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:42,140
我也是个老烟枪
但你丢东西应该小心点

65
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:44,941
我没有被烫伤

66
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,247
当疼痛消退之后
我才注意到这个人好帅

67
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,448
抱歉，我叫派崔克凯西

68
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,957
我叫凯莉布雷萧，烫伤患者

69
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:59,693
这种控诉太过强烈了

70
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:03,800
不过这样搭讪倒是挺高竿的

71
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:07,563
-原来这是你演的一出喜剧？
-有点那个意味

72
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:10,274
真的很抱歉

73
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,501
我请你喝杯咖啡作为补偿

74
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:18,740
不好笑
不过喝咖啡这提议不错

75
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,819
街角有家咖啡店
那里可以抽烟

76
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,421
在抽过两、三支烟之后

77
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:29,822
我发现派崔克在做电影配乐

78
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:32,223
你做的是哪种电影？

79
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:36,231
那都是些三流片

80
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,766
好比「去年夏天夜惊魂」
之类的电影

81
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,532
只要你对电影还有抱负就够了

82
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:44,742
糟糕，派崔克凯西

83
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:48,674
不管你叫甚么，我必须走了

84
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:55,582
谢谢你的咖啡
改天我再控诉内心受到的创伤

85
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:59,517
-你真会说话
-谢谢

86
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:02,620
当我离开的时候才想到

87
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:04,796
世上有几个长相与头脑兼具的
单身老烟枪？

88
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,057
七个吗？

89
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,465
接著我便做出破天荒的举动
给他我的手机号码

90
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:19,302
我这件烫伤诉讼
可能会有点难搞

91
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:23,572
这是我的电话号码

92
00:06:23,782 --> 00:06:25,306
你请律师时会用到

93
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:28,418
或许下次可以再请我喝咖啡

94
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,614
这招让我自己都得意不已
他不打给我才有鬼

95
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:37,090
都过了三天他怎么还没打来？

96
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:41,255
再等他12小时
到时候就把他踢到荒岛去

97
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,434
我不想踢他走，我喜欢他

98
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:47,901
你相信有人把这种颜色
叫做佛罗伦斯桃红吗？

99
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,472
你怎么舍得在床单上
花这么多钱？

100
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:54,077
我在做一项试验
改变我的命运

101
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,942
我想如果能把床
布置成我的梦想乐园

102
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,482
别人也会感同身受

103
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:04,952
-你是说梦想乐土
-没错，所谓心想事成

104
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:09,992
没想到我给了电话的人
竟然不回我电话

105
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:12,857
我都是看准对象才给电话的

106
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:17,297
我现在对这个颜色
还没有明显的喜好

107
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:21,632
-他一定认为我很「爱国」
-拜托，别闹了

108
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:24,808
一个家伙三天不打电话给你
你就变成丑女了吗？

109
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,911
-你想说甚么？
-枕头套给我

110
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:31,913
我们原先都觉得自己很好

111
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:37,612
可是一走出去
男人要是不看我们…

112
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,916
这实在太荒谬了，该死

113
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,822
我费心打理的卧室
竟然还是有瑕疵

114
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:51,227
第二天我在街上找寻廉价洋装

115
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,461
好搭配我花三百美金买的鞋子

116
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:57,101
其实我这时候可以转身离去

117
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:00,676
但我却面带微笑
深呼吸一口气就走了过去

118
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,719
好好的星期六
你竟然站在大街上抽烟？

119
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:14,223
-你好，我叫凯莉
-我们正在谈事情

120
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:17,452
好的，我了解

121
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,860
-再见，我正要去佩里街
-这就是佩里街

122
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:26,799
我是说布利克街
再见，不打搅你们了

123
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,739
-凯莉，你听我解释
-不用，我是自找难堪

124
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:40,941
你显然正在和你的爱人谈事情

125
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:46,420
不，我不是同性恋
我只是有酗酒的毛病

126
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:49,225
我们正在这里等著聚会

127
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:53,023
我本来想为你介绍
但是我不能透露会友的名字

128
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:56,200
我并不是觉得你们像同性恋

129
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:59,029
只是他长得很帅，再加上…

130
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:01,330
-我没打电话给你
-没错

131
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,667
我戒酒已经11个月了

132
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:10,371
我的监护人要我在一年内
不能谈感情

133
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,544
好吧，那你一个月后再打给我

134
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:16,482
你不在意我是个酒鬼吗？

135
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:22,058
不会，我喜欢酒鬼
我甚至也想当个酒鬼

136
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,127
-我开玩笑的
-一点也不好笑

137
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,764
喝杯咖啡也许就不一样了

138
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:32,629
其实也不过只剩下几星期
你改天愿意出去吗？

139
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:36,307
有何不可？你再联络我

140
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:41,408
于是我便接受了他的邀约

141
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:45,413
其实每个人都在戒某些东西
好比戒酒、戒毒

142
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:47,642
甚至是戒上一段感情吗？

143
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:51,050
我们第一次约会是出去喝咖啡

144
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:54,521
我有点强迫症的毛病
只要打开一包洋芋片

145
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:56,557
就一定要整包吃完

146
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,562
蕊丝皮鞋一出新款
我也一定会去买

147
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:04,190
吃鞋子不太好消化吧？

148
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:07,471
我家到了

149
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:12,243
谢谢你，凯西先生
我玩得很愉快

150
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:16,106
烫伤小姐，我也过得很愉快

151
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:21,274
于是我示意他给我一个告别吻

152
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,357
第二次出去晚餐时他谈了
许多有关音乐的事

153
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,297
饭后我站在楼梯上企图勾引他

154
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,302
好香，这是甚么味道？

155
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,407
我

156
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:48,676
我再打电话给你

157
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:52,142
我实在想不通

158
00:10:57,255 --> 00:11:00,691
我知道他想要我
因为在我靠近的时候

159
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:04,157
意外的感觉到他的小弟弟
正在对我「举枪致敬」

160
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:06,353
但他怎么没采取行动？

161
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:11,629
第三次约会时我对他的渴望
已经超过蕊丝皮鞋了

162
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,408
好了，晚安

163
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:21,943
我的羞辱已经到达了极限

164
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,445
但我又想到这个世上…

165
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,449
还剩几个聪明的帅哥？
五个吗？

166
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,562
-你想上去吗？
-想

167
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:49,035
但是我从来没在
清醒的时候做爱过

168
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:53,234
我总是喝得酪酊大醉
我不肯定自己的表现如何

169
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:59,107
管他的，船到桥头自然直

170
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:15,364
性爱真是太神奇了

171
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:21,405
真是不可思议
别人有这种感觉吗？

172
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:28,574
太棒了，我再也不怕做爱了

173
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:36,843
-冷静点，牛仔
-至于均KA

174
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:40,149
-你真是妙不可言
-你也不差

175
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:44,317
不，你是最棒的

176
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,588
我是很努力

177
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:51,000
等我们抽完这根烟…

178
00:12:55,273 --> 00:12:57,468
可以再来一次吗？

179
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:04,044
我要一份蛋饼、马铃薯煎饼
再来一杯咖啡和柳橙汁

180
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:09,152
稍后再来一份布丁，谢谢

181
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:12,414
-你在准备冬眠吗？
-不，我快饿死了

182
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:15,388
我和派崔克忙了一夜
把我饿坏了

183
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:21,028
你尽管说，我的表现差
不表示你们都要和我一样

184
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:25,032
你在床上的表现一点也不差

185
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,535
有人在和你做爱的时候
睡著吗？

186
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,437
没有，但我有一次差点睡著

187
00:13:32,644 --> 00:13:35,340
无所谓，我是个成年女人

188
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:40,246
我很清楚我对服饰搭配很在行

189
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,750
但某些事却需要别人帮助

190
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:46,321
-好比上床？
-做爱

191
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:49,755
所以我去报了一堂课

192
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:53,988
-学习床上技巧吗？
-不，是性爱研讨会

193
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:57,225
你只要别喝甚么诡异的饮料
或穿新布鞋就行了

194
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:01,599
讲师是一位
德高望重的心理学家

195
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,673
这堂课叫「如何愉悦男人？」

196
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:08,607
只要放弃你的权力
就能愉悦男人

197
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:12,249
我到健身房会找教练
当然也可以找人…

198
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,045
-教你做爱？
-别再说这个字了

199
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:17,778
你真的要去上课？

200
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:22,688
对，人数还有限制
我就帮你们报了名

201
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:27,460
拜托，我不能一个人去

202
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:31,192
布莱姆要是再在我身上睡著
我一定会死，拜托

203
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:35,167
-求求你们，好姊妹
-我去

204
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:38,809
好吧，其实去听听也无妨

205
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,413
如何愉悦男人？
我都可以开班授课了

206
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,617
好吧

207
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:55,655
当晚两个大卫先脱了衣服
在卧室里等她

208
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,762
莎曼珊才开始犹豫
这次玩得会不会太过火了

209
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:03,195
她能接受这种放荡的性爱吗？

210
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,835
还是她只是一时鬼迷心窍？

211
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:10,133
她认为在后悔之前
他们应该再商量一次

212
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,972
大卫，我想或许…

213
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,276
-你真的好美
-就像「红尘」里的珍哈露

214
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:23,420
莎曼珊立刻爱上了
他们眼中的自己

215
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:25,316
试试又有何妨

216
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,229
-真软
-没错

217
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:28,176
-我做不下去
-我也是

218
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:34,255
但是我…我们才刚开始

219
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:37,257
不，我做不下去，抱歉

220
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:41,057
抱歉，你的确秀色可餐
但我做不到

221
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:43,834
问题不在你，是在我们

222
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:47,971
不如这样吧？
我们穿上衣服去吃义大利果冻

223
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,505
-或是起司蛋糕
-都好

224
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:57,241
莎曼珊突然对自己丧失了信心

225
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:07,017
我得走了
不然会赶不上那个研习会

226
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:11,161
宝贝，你根本不用听那劳什子

227
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:16,322
你是个中高手，我们再来一次

228
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,968
昨晚和今早做得还不够吗？

229
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,934
和你整天整夜做爱我也不会腻

230
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,769
这时我了解到这个大男人
根本不是和我做爱

231
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:31,041
他是在和一大袋的洋芋片挣扎

232
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:37,586
「坦特罗」的意思就是
神圣的性爱

233
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:41,748
体验神人合一的感受

234
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,761
我看派崔克已经迷上我了
他想用我来取代酗酒

235
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,867
在戒酒的家伙都很难搞
我和一个暴食症患者交往过

236
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:55,199
我们只要一吵架
他就会开始狂吃圣代

237
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,104
换句话说
你能让你的另一半疯狂

238
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:04,042
他整天都想和我做爱
我都快控制不了了

239
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,343
-至少他还想碰你
-他们是同性恋

240
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:12,114
那又怎样？前一秒还兴致高昂
下一秒就没了兴致

241
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:14,757
我到底做错了甚么？

242
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:18,588
错就错在你没有老二

243
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:20,764
姊妹们，这太没礼貌了

244
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:27,803
你可以用爱让任何一个男人
对你俯首称臣

245
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,736
我昨晚需要她的时候
这个女人在哪里？

246
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:34,708
安静听你们就会学到东西
她是这方面的天才

247
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:37,540
她如果真的这么行

248
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,616
-干嘛在公寓里开这个研习会
-不要问我

249
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:46,654
「坦氏性爱」不重理论
而重于行动

250
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,349
我们也要为大家示范

251
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,554
现在就立刻开始

252
00:18:54,732 --> 00:18:58,259
容我介绍我的先生

253
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:02,735
罗尼莎菲洛博士

254
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:06,201
由我来示范…

255
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:10,814
最有效的生殖器按摩术

256
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,418
我终于明白为甚么在这开课了

257
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:23,720
接受按摩者必须赤裸的
躺在按摩者前方

258
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:28,297
让生殖器完全曝露出来

259
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,296
你根本没在做笔记

260
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:34,631
按摩需要耐心

261
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:38,899
如果是车祸一个半小时后
或许还看不到车祸的真相

262
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,103
但这对夫妇却呈现了
坦氏性爱的效果

263
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:49,514
把你的手当成果汁机一样
按摩龟头部分

264
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,088
我早上吃的东西快吐出来了

265
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,919
别吵了，别丢我的脸好吗？

266
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:59,585
现在丢脸的是我们吗？

267
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:02,664
接著抬起右手

268
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,097
握住对方的命根子

269
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:07,736
命根子

270
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:14,310
它就位在肛门和外生殖器之间

271
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:16,275
看来这五十元美金很值得

272
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:22,784
轻轻的唤醒这个部分

273
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:26,047
这个部位在医学上叫做会阴

274
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:29,818
在拉丁语的意思就是
「结婚一定要有婚戒」

275
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:34,930
请那位在笑的小姐安静，谢谢

276
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:39,593
高潮虽然不是这种按摩的目的

277
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:45,275
却是种非常愉悦的副作用

278
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:48,673
请各位注意

279
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:56,116
只要掌握住诀窍
保证男人会永远效忠于你

280
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,691
因为他们只要做过这种按摩
就永远忘不了

281
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,693
加油

282
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:10,095
看到没？看清楚了没有？

283
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:17,034
我的天，他快要…

284
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,710
米兰达还被他的精液喷到了

285
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,480
有这么好笑吗？

286
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:40,290
那天稍晚我和派崔克去看电影

287
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:43,626
我今天和监护人谈起
我对你的感觉

288
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:48,669
我觉得我应该告诉你

289
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:50,932
凯莉

290
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:54,102
-我爱你
-老实说

291
00:21:54,312 --> 00:21:56,507
这是每个女人在交往之后

292
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:59,740
都想听到的一句话

293
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:04,212
谢谢你，我真的觉得…

294
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:08,792
你觉得进展得太快了吗？

295
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:12,121
我们只交往了几天而已

296
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,767
可是我不想玩游戏
我只想忠于自己的感觉

297
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:20,797
我爱你

298
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:27,102
凯西先生，你并不是爱我
而是爱上清醒的感觉罢了

299
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:29,745
不，我爱你

300
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:33,306
你听我说…

301
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,682
我真的受宠若惊

302
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,017
我们或许该放慢一点

303
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:46,128
-甚么意思？
-事情发展得太快了

304
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,163
你初次体验到不喝酒的感觉

305
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,631
不，别对我说这些聚会的说辞

306
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,304
这件事和喝酒无关

307
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:58,771
我爱你

308
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:03,778
或许我们该分开几天

309
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:07,075
-我明天打电话给你
-我不能上楼去吗？

310
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:11,221
-忍耐几晚就好了
-你要和我分手吗？

311
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:16,090
派崔克，我不是要和你分手
我只是要进屋去

312
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:21,092
你明天打电话给我
我们下星期再碰面好吗？

313
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:27,670
-那我现在怎么办？
-你应该去聚会了

314
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:30,567
然后回家，明天打电话给我

315
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:36,636
晚安，下星期见

316
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,578
走吧

317
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:51,925
买点饼乾来吃

318
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:58,562
这时候夏绿蒂正在家里…

319
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:00,896
夏绿蒂，你在做甚么？

320
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:08,911
夏绿蒂，你真棒
我的天，你真棒

321
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:12,640
夏绿蒂认为那是她花过
最值得的五十元美金

322
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:21,653
米兰达花的钱虽然比较多
但结果也不错

323
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,402
凯莉

324
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:51,018
派崔克，你在做甚么？

325
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:53,383
-你这个臭婆娘
-该死

326
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:58,691
我爱你，你却不爱我

327
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:02,593
你让我在完成戒酒前一个月
就和你约会

328
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:07,903
现在我又开始酗酒了
我不在乎

329
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:13,371
凯莉，我爱你

330
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:16,410
我爱你，和我做爱

331
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:21,741
你在做甚么？别把衣服脱掉

332
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:25,115
我第一个念头是冲下去救他

333
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:28,758
但我在和他第二次出去时知道
这会变成一种惯性

334
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:31,951
但我还是想做点甚么

335
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,893
把这穿上，你会著凉的

336
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:38,262
我真希望我死掉

337
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,106
-你再不安静我就报警
-你给我闭嘴

338
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:49,979
凯莉，你是我上过最棒的女人

339
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:55,881
三星期后派崔克写了封信给我
说他又回去戒酒了

340
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,885
之后我没有再见过他
但我一直在想两件事情

341
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,550
一是他戒酒有没有成功？
还有我在床上真的这么棒吗？
