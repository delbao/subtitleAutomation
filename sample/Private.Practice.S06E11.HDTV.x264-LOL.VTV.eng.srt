1
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:06,725
I am 407 days sober.

2
00:00:06,793 --> 00:00:08,913
I debated whether or not I
should say the exact number

3
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:10,696
or just rough it, but I figured,

4
00:00:10,763 --> 00:00:13,532
I've earned every day so...

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,235
My friend Charlotte was 8 weeks pregnant

6
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:18,269
when I celebrated a year.

7
00:00:18,337 --> 00:00:19,737
I use her to keep track.

8
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:21,772
If she were here, she would probably say,

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,140
"glad somebody's getting something useful

10
00:00:23,209 --> 00:00:24,809
out of this pregnancy."

11
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:28,813
S... sounds less awful if you know her.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,217
I'm doing okay in my second year.

13
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:33,984
I got this great new apartment.

14
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:35,652
Been there a couple of months.

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,688
I'm really trying to make it a home.

16
00:00:37,755 --> 00:00:40,357
It's been a while since
I've been on my own,

17
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:42,659
but I'm adjusting.

18
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:44,160
Ew.

19
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:46,730
It's nice to have my own kitchen,

20
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,565
be able to cook whatever I want.

21
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:53,236
And I started working out again,

22
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,372
which is good, you know...

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,474
and healthy.

24
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:01,977
Year two is a challenge,

25
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:04,179
but I'm ready.

26
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:05,748
And it's all about growth,

27
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,983
and I've set myself up to grow.

28
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:12,721
I'm good.

29
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:15,189
I'm really good.

30
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:21,996
- synced and corrected by chamallow -

31
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:30,515
Holla.

32
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,283
"Holla"? Good weekend?

33
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:34,853
Didn't leave my apartment. Unpacked.

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,721
You've been there three months.

35
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:37,922
I'm methodical.

36
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,155
You should be out there,

37
00:01:39,223 --> 00:01:40,858
doing things that make me feel old.

38
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:42,493
She did greet us with a holla.

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,861
Thank you, Coop.

40
00:01:43,928 --> 00:01:45,596
Have you met any of your neighbors?

41
00:01:45,663 --> 00:01:47,698
I'm focused on my recovery.

42
00:01:47,765 --> 00:01:50,634
Well, socialization is an
important part of your recovery.

43
00:01:50,702 --> 00:01:51,969
Have you considered dating?

44
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:54,104
So I can see how quickly
I make dudes my age

45
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:55,972
sprint in the other direction?

46
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,507
Aw. Oh, come on. We're all doctors.

47
00:01:57,574 --> 00:01:59,575
We're doctors with friends
who don't scare easily.

48
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:01,043
Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:02,745
Would you be open to dating
someone we all vetted?

50
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:04,380
If I say no, it'll be a thing, right?

51
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:05,548
- Yes. Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

52
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:06,782
Fine.

53
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,819
Just don't make me regret it.

54
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:11,553
It was great, right?

55
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:12,721
Don't answer.

56
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:14,956
I already know.

57
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:16,825
Did you like your steak?

58
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:18,126
You don't already know?

59
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:20,929
So you liked it?

60
00:02:20,997 --> 00:02:23,331
Almost as much as you ordering it for me.

61
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:25,333
Was that sarcasm?

62
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:27,635
You'd tell me if that was sarcasm, right?

63
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:29,069
Thanks.

64
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:31,539
Could we split this, please?

65
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:33,040
Yeah.

66
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:34,575
You're really interested in this?

67
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:36,043
You cut into people's brains.

68
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,277
If that's not interesting,

69
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:39,013
then what's the hope for the rest of us?

70
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:44,350
Something wrong?

71
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:46,318
Nah.

72
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:50,523
Are you sure?

73
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:51,791
Yeah.

74
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:53,660
She just thinks when she says "jump,"

75
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:55,428
I should say, "how high?"

76
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:56,596
She?

77
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:58,631
My ex-wife.

78
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:04,170
You know, it was perfect,

79
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:06,238
and then all of a sudden, it wasn't.

80
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:08,407
She doesn't think I deserve an explanation.

81
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:11,877
But... she still tells me
she loves me when she drinks.

82
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:15,047
I'm gonna cry.

83
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,321
Ahh.

84
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:26,391
Uh...

85
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:29,527
Mm.

86
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:35,399
Uh...

87
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,167
- Should we split the check?
- We should split the check, yeah.

88
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,036
I mean, are... were you
guys also part of the team

89
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:41,405
that vetted Sarah Palin?

90
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:42,639
I'm so sorry.

91
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:44,141
I thought George was over her.

92
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,010
And I thought Marshall was a
good old-fashioned Texas boy.

93
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:49,212
What are we talking about?

94
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,519
Amelia's awful dates.

95
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:51,714
Oh, you're dating. Oh, that... that's good.

96
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:53,682
Yeah, no. That's over.

97
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,918
Oh, come on. Bad dates are
kind of a necessary evil.

98
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,820
I dated a poet once.

99
00:03:57,887 --> 00:03:59,322
He was a really, really bad poet.

100
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,724
Turns out the odds of
finding a... a Poe or a Frost

101
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,292
are like a million to one.

102
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,027
Dating Edgar Allan Poe
would probably be a drag.

103
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,663
I mean, if I had to imagine.

104
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:09,764
I mean, finding someone
shouldn't feel like a job.

105
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,333
My parents met at a dance.

106
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,967
They both walked in, saw
each other across the room,

107
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:14,336
that was it.

108
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:15,970
Yeah, but that was a different time.

109
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:18,273
Okay, miss "I met my guy at the grocery."

110
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,781
Oh, I went out with a guy

111
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,708
who said he knew the
best brunch spot in L.A.

112
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:23,344
Well, he wasn't lying.

113
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:25,979
The rub was, it was
being served by his cult.

114
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:27,414
Ohh.

115
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:28,669
I'll do you one better.

116
00:04:28,737 --> 00:04:29,837
Imagine you're having a lovely time,

117
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:31,005
and then at the end of the night,

118
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:32,974
your date is engaged to someone else.

119
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,275
Oh.

120
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:36,009
I never thanked you for that dinner.

121
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:37,277
You're welcome.

122
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:38,644
Okay, all of this is just making my couch

123
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,347
seem that much more appealing.

124
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,882
Who are you gonna meet on your couch?

125
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,483
Oh, I met Cooper on my couch.

126
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,751
Or was I in bed?

127
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,386
Uh, you met Cooper on a sex site.

128
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,288
I mean, it was probably
the bedroom, I would guess.

129
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:50,423
I'm not trolling the Internet for dates.

130
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:54,293
I've seen what's out
there. Alone is better.

131
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,063
I guess my agent can submit me

132
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,698
for bride of Frankenstein now.

133
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,133
I get that she's a monster.

134
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,501
But I always thought
she was too good for him.

135
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,305
Been in anything I may have seen?

136
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,841
Hmm. Ever been to the Linden
Boulevard church in Albuquerque?

137
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,310
Can't say that I have.

138
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,577
I know I'm starting out here

139
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:14,979
about ten years too late,

140
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,848
but this is the only
thing I've always wanted.

141
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,051
And I just keep coming back to it.

142
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,653
After college, I had
loans, and my mom got sick.

143
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:25,822
I stayed with her till she passed.

144
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,627
Six months ago, I decided to
get in the car and just drive.

145
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:32,930
Doesn't work out, at least I tried.

146
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:35,498
And I got to smell the ocean
every morning along the way.

147
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,134
Not so bad, right?

148
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:39,268
You paged me, Dr. Peterson?

149
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:41,603
She refuses to call me James.

150
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:43,572
This is Kaye, new onset seizure.

151
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,775
I was at an audition...
my first real audition...

152
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:49,145
and the only thing I
remember is hearing my name.

153
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:51,080
I'm not holding my breath for a callback.

154
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:53,782
Presented with a classic
tonic-clonic seizure.

155
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,950
I stabilized her with 10
milligrams of lorazepam.

156
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:57,319
Small lac secondary to the fall.

157
00:05:57,386 --> 00:05:59,687
Ordered tests on the usual suspects.

158
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:01,056
Any previous history of seizures?

159
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:02,690
Recent headaches,

160
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:04,559
dizziness, visual changes,

161
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:05,760
numbness, or weakness?

162
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:06,962
Nothing.

163
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:09,564
New meds? Drug or alcohol history?

164
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:10,865
Damn it.

165
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:12,666
Another 10 milligrams of lorazepam.

166
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,068
Protect her airway.

167
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:17,838
Pulse ox is dropping.

168
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:19,840
She's not breathing.
We may need to tube her.

169
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:21,708
Wait. Just give it a sec.

170
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:32,385
Let's get a C.T. See what's up.

171
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:35,955
Keep me in the loop?

172
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:40,460
Dr. Shepherd.

173
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:41,594
It's Friday.

174
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,637
What do you kids want for dinner?

175
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:47,899
French fries! French fries!

176
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:49,401
They want French fries,

177
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:50,909
and you don't want to break the bank.

178
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,650
So why not turn that tired sack of potatoes

179
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:55,007
into something your kids actually want

180
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:57,009
with the e-z cut American fry maker?

181
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:58,977
Adjust the blade settings, and snap!

182
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,177
Traditional cut...

183
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:01,479
shoestring...

184
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,047
even restaurant-quality steak fries...

185
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,883
really, really good fries.

186
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,784
You know Billy's on north canon?

187
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:10,388
I'm there every Friday night.
Really, really good fries.

188
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:12,656
When's the last time you had really,

189
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,658
really good homemade fries?

190
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,726
Really, really good
fries are hard to come by.

191
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:24,734
Really, really good fries.

192
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:25,768
I prefer steak fries,

193
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:27,637
but I guess these will do.

194
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:35,277
Just be careful with the ketchup.

195
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:36,745
"Speed"?

196
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:38,247
Yeah. Every woman I know
prefers "Speed" over "Die Hard."

197
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:41,050
Of course they do, because
"Speed's" about Keanu

198
00:07:41,117 --> 00:07:42,484
doing everything that
he can to protect Sandy.

199
00:07:42,552 --> 00:07:44,386
Every girl wants that.

200
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:46,355
You have such pretty eyes.

201
00:07:46,423 --> 00:07:48,656
Abandoning the subtle flirtation thing.

202
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:49,924
And smart...

203
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:51,125
- Stop.
- And challenging.

204
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:52,293
Are you always this aggressive?

205
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,062
I'm a douchey E.R. doc, remember?

206
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:55,829
- Does it work?
- You're here.

207
00:07:55,897 --> 00:07:57,198
That does not answer my...

208
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:58,266
Only you can answer that question.

209
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,534
Why did you come?

210
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:02,603
I wanted to discuss Kaye.

211
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:03,937
Our stable patient whose test results

212
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:05,638
won't be complete until the morning?

213
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:07,607
Why did you come?

214
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,010
What would you say if I told you

215
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,879
that my TV told me to?

216
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:14,647
Does that happen often?

217
00:08:14,715 --> 00:08:16,516
Mm. First time.

218
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,819
What time is it?

219
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:21,588
I don't know.

220
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,456
Well, you didn't look at your watch.

221
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,464
Oh, my God.

222
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:33,566
It is almost midnight. I gotta go.

223
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:35,934
That's why I didn't want
you to know what time it was.

224
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:48,346
Please express my gratitude
to your television.

225
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:50,015
Mm. Oh, uh, your jacket.

226
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,949
No. Keep it.

227
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:53,537
That way, you have to talk to me again.

228
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:56,286
And if you don't, I'll
have you arrested for theft.

229
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,425
The valet probably wants to go, so...

230
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,372
Okay.

231
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:37,970
When a girl lets a guy buy her dinner,

232
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:40,539
she has certain expectations.

233
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,274
What are you talking about?

234
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:45,178
"Really, really good
fries are hard to come by."

235
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:46,311
You were in my head.

236
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,146
You went out with James?

237
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:50,849
Being alone wasn't terrible.

238
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,283
I... I was nesting.

239
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:54,252
I was making progress on my apartment...

240
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,420
Sort of.

241
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:57,222
Now all I can think about

242
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:58,990
is mixed-message James not kissing me.

243
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,926
I mean, I am not the girl who sits around

244
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:02,193
trying to unmix messages.

245
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,393
I mix them.

246
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:04,729
I think I follow that.

247
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:06,496
Look, this...

248
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,298
this part of the relationship
happens only once.

249
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:10,067
There is no relationship.

250
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:12,169
Okay, what I'm trying to say is,

251
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,004
let the attraction percolate.

252
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,773
Play hard to get?

253
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:16,941
I didn't say that.

254
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:18,208
But it does work.

255
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:21,310
Yeah.

256
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:23,613
I'm not doing that.

257
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,881
Kaye has no trauma

258
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:26,783
or family history of epilepsy.

259
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:29,219
Tox screen is negative. Not drugs.

260
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:30,887
Electrolytes?

261
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:33,089
Normal.

262
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:34,623
Do you have plans tonight?

263
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:38,693
I do.

264
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:40,295
Well, when you have time,

265
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:42,831
I'd love to take you to
my favorite Italian place.

266
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,933
Yeah. I'm pretty busy until next week.

267
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:46,935
Kaye is new to L.A.?

268
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:48,904
Uh, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

269
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:50,905
Hmm. The desert.

270
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:53,107
Environmental?

271
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:55,076
Fungus. A... a fungal infection, maybe?

272
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:57,578
Titers are high for cocci meningitis.

273
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:59,046
Okay.

274
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:01,949
Well, now all we have
to do is find the lesions

275
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:05,186
and...

276
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:06,519
found one.

277
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:08,188
Right here in the cortical area.

278
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,056
I'll schedule a biopsy for tomorrow.

279
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:11,758
You're gonna do brain surgery?

280
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:13,994
Well, a biopsy will confirm the diagnosis.

281
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:15,262
You're gonna cut into her head

282
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:16,329
when we could treat her with antifungals

283
00:11:16,397 --> 00:11:17,931
and keep a close eye on her?

284
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:21,701
My way is faster and definitive.

285
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:22,835
It'll also take her out of auditions

286
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,904
for longer than she can afford.

287
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:26,872
All signs point to a fungal infection,

288
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,941
which, if you don't mind me saying,

289
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:30,142
was a magnificent catch.

290
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,077
Okay. Don't try to suck up to me

291
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:33,645
just so that I'll do what you want.

292
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:35,480
I wasn't. It was magnificent.

293
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:36,715
Uh-huh.

294
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,049
But I was hoping getting my way

295
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:39,583
would be an unintended
benefit of stating the truth.

296
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:41,786
We can schedule a
follow-up C.T. in a month.

297
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,026
She stays on the anticonvulsants,

298
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:51,863
and we schedule a follow-up in a week.

299
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:54,397
Are you really busy tonight
or are you playing hard to get?

300
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:58,202
Well, I... have a lot
on my plate right now.

301
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:02,772
If next week is the soonest
I can see you, okay, but...

302
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:06,443
I was really hoping to spend
some time with you before then.

303
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,279
How did you score a table
overlooking the kitchen?

304
00:12:09,347 --> 00:12:11,214
I took care of the chef's daughter

305
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:12,648
a few months ago.

306
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:14,616
High fever, vomiting.

307
00:12:14,684 --> 00:12:16,986
My intern diagnosed the flu,
was about to send her home,

308
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:19,255
but I had a feeling.

309
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,123
We did a spinal tap...

310
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,658
bacterial meningitis.

311
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:25,794
I saved her.

312
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:29,064
Well... this is me.

313
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,805
Thank you for dinner.
That was really lovely.

314
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:40,175
I had a wonderful time.

315
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:42,276
Me, too.

316
00:12:46,114 --> 00:12:47,514
Get home safely.

317
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,485
Yeah.

318
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:54,821
Okay.

319
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:58,524
But it doesn't make sense.

320
00:12:58,592 --> 00:13:00,326
I'm hot. I would kiss me.

321
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:01,794
Wouldn't you kiss me?

322
00:13:01,862 --> 00:13:03,229
- Absolutely.
- I would, yes.

323
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:05,265
I didn't ask for this. He pursued me.

324
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:06,832
Would not let it go.

325
00:13:06,901 --> 00:13:08,734
Finally I gave in, this is what I get.

326
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:10,736
You can't let it upset you.

327
00:13:10,804 --> 00:13:12,138
I'm not upset. I'm pissed.

328
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:14,106
Maybe he's just not that into you.

329
00:13:15,218 --> 00:13:16,518
I've always wanted to say that.

330
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:18,286
Maybe now is not the right time, Addison.

331
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:20,689
I got waxed. Like "waxed" waxed.

332
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:22,357
I spent a small fortune
on new underwear and heels,

333
00:13:22,425 --> 00:13:24,760
both of which are supremely uncomfortable,

334
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:26,361
and for what?

335
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:28,964
Oh, the things we do. Women.

336
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:31,232
I mean, why, when we could
be on our couch in sweats,

337
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:33,935
vegging out to a marathon
of "bitch snapped"?

338
00:13:34,002 --> 00:13:35,169
Because you like him.

339
00:13:35,237 --> 00:13:36,337
I want to do something that justifies

340
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:38,272
the pain I'm inflicting upon myself.

341
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,573
Do you think he's...

342
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:40,875
He's not gay.

343
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:42,043
Maybe he got over a really bad break-up

344
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:43,644
- and he wants to go slowly.
- Mm.

345
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:45,179
Is that really a thing, going slowly?

346
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:46,546
I mean, doesn't that
only happen in the movies?

347
00:13:46,614 --> 00:13:48,281
I'm done. I'm j... I'm done.

348
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:49,883
No, you cannot quit.

349
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,785
And you can't put all
your eggs in one basket.

350
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:53,353
The quest to find somebody

351
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,455
to spend your life with is not easy.

352
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:57,257
You need time and fortitude.

353
00:13:57,324 --> 00:13:58,691
Do you hear yourself?

354
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,460
I... I was just looking
to get out of my apartment.

355
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:02,094
Okay. Well...

356
00:14:02,162 --> 00:14:03,695
then staying in that vein,
humor me a little longer.

357
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:04,930
Are you free tonight?

358
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:06,431
No, really.

359
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,200
I mean, you could stay home...

360
00:14:08,268 --> 00:14:10,302
and wonder why James isn't kissing you...

361
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,771
or...

362
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:13,038
Ah.

363
00:14:13,106 --> 00:14:14,706
Ortho surgeon.

364
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:17,076
Totally single. Great conversationalist.

365
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:18,910
- Mm.
- Definitely not a sociopath.

366
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:21,345
Want me to see if he's free tonight?

367
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:25,183
Well, you're already waxed.

368
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,421
Mm. Okay.

369
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,524
James.

370
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:35,826
You look beautiful. Date?

371
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:38,329
Yeah. I, uh, actually was on my way out.

372
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:39,697
Cool.

373
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:42,333
I can't stay but a
minute. Middle of my shift.

374
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:43,834
It's just...

375
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:47,705
the anticipation was killing me.

376
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,931
Enjoy your date.

377
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,720
Gone?

378
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:34,422
Like... like completely gone?

379
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,924
There's no trace of the lesion.

380
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:38,293
The antifungals were effective.

381
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,861
So no more falling on my face at auditions

382
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:41,362
in the literal sense?

383
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,630
There is no reason to suspect

384
00:15:42,698 --> 00:15:43,864
that you'll have another seizure.

385
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:45,266
I'd already called my dad

386
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:46,934
and told him that I
might have to come home.

387
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:50,338
Thank you.

388
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:52,072
Both of you.

389
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,574
Oh, if I leave now,

390
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:55,576
I can still make it to
my class across town.

391
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:57,277
Thanks.

392
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:03,016
Did you ever have that much energy?

393
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,250
Yep.

394
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,485
I know I should wait until tonight,

395
00:16:05,553 --> 00:16:06,720
but now that the patient's gone...

396
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:08,855
You can totally kiss me.

397
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:14,960
Condoms...

398
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:17,296
ribbed, glow-in-the-dark, tingling?

399
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:20,032
Which is usually the sensation
that sends you to the doctor.

400
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:21,434
Slow down. Back it up.

401
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:23,135
I'm seeing someone.

402
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:24,370
James.

403
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:25,438
You know? Of course you know.

404
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:26,706
Doesn't matter.

405
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:28,173
What matters is, I went
to buy condoms today,

406
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:30,508
and there are, like, a billion choices,

407
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:32,977
and I don't want to insult
him by not buying magnums

408
00:16:33,045 --> 00:16:34,479
or buying them and making him think

409
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:36,448
that my previous boyfriends are the Lakers.

410
00:16:36,515 --> 00:16:38,182
Well, since when are you shy about sex?

411
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,652
I... I'm not. I just
don't want to offend James.

412
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,153
Ah, that's crap. I think this is about you

413
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:44,155
gettin' back in the saddle after a year.

414
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:46,156
I don't know. Maybe.

415
00:16:46,224 --> 00:16:47,791
You doin' what you need to do?

416
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:49,393
I'm here talking to you.

417
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:50,794
That's not what I mean.

418
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,195
I am getting to meetings.

419
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:54,130
- You know why I'm asking.
- I know why you're asking.

420
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:55,566
When you meet someone new,

421
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:57,568
sometimes sobriety takes a backseat.

422
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:58,935
You start cutting corners, and then...

423
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:00,770
You slip. I get it.

424
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:03,239
Last time you had sex, you woke up to...

425
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:04,607
A dead Ryan.

426
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:07,643
Yes... I remember.

427
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:10,112
But it's not gonna be a thing.

428
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,247
You sure?

429
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:14,116
I'm sure. I'm ready.

430
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:16,018
I just need that push.

431
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:22,791
Oh.

432
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:31,833
Ahh.

433
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:35,703
Ribbed, glow-in the dark, tingling.

434
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:37,772
They call this one "the soldier."

435
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,972
Huh.

436
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,408
Trial and error.

437
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,309
Find out what works for you,

438
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:43,477
and have fun doing it.

439
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,548
Oh. Just in case.

440
00:17:56,924 --> 00:17:58,090
Hey.

441
00:17:58,158 --> 00:18:00,192
Wow.

442
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:22,146
Yeah?

443
00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:23,815
Please.

444
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,090
Hey.

445
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:34,692
Wow.

446
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:46,736
Do you have a condom?

447
00:18:46,804 --> 00:18:49,706
I didn't want to be presumptuous.

448
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:51,074
I have some.

449
00:18:51,141 --> 00:18:53,542
I think.

450
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:00,883
You are so gorgeous.

451
00:19:04,955 --> 00:19:06,956
You are so gorgeous.

452
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:28,041
What's wrong?

453
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:30,210
Sorry. Uh...

454
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:31,879
Can you not touch me?

455
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,218
Are you...

456
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:55,902
You're here.

457
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:58,737
Yeah.

458
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:00,138
I got this thing

459
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:02,073
where I can't let a
date end in tears, so...

460
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:08,847
I was gonna make you breakfast, but...

461
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:12,850
you only have salsa, ice cream, and bread.

462
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:14,785
Bon appétit.

463
00:20:18,356 --> 00:20:20,958
I owe you an explanation.

464
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:22,359
You don't.

465
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,565
I like you.

466
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:30,833
And last night, I wanted to.

467
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:32,602
I mean, I've got enough condoms

468
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,203
to supply a frat house.

469
00:20:37,307 --> 00:20:40,043
I thought I was ready.

470
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:45,513
But then when you started
taking off my dress...

471
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:52,487
I haven't had sex with someone
who mattered in a long time.

472
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:55,523
And now I'm sober,

473
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:57,092
and I'm in a good place,

474
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:58,694
but in some ways I'm still a mess.

475
00:20:58,761 --> 00:21:03,931
So...

476
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:06,033
I'm giving you an out.

477
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:29,055
What do you want on your toast,

478
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:30,924
salsa or ice cream?

479
00:22:37,827 --> 00:22:39,694
What are you lookin' at?

480
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:41,429
You.

481
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:45,299
No, what are you looking at?

482
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:47,068
I have a freckle.

483
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:50,404
What about it?

484
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:53,340
It looks like Indiana.

485
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:56,042
Can I kiss it?

486
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,045
Mm. You're going to anyway.

487
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:11,824
I see a few more down here
that require my attention.

488
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:15,828
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

489
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,404
What are you thinking about?

490
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,375
I don't know.

491
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,677
Don't know or won't say?

492
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,483
I'm not thinking about anything.

493
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:43,286
And that's good.

494
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:03,272
Why don't you drink?

495
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:07,510
You don't really...

496
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:08,678
I do.

497
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,647
Really.

498
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:16,552
I'm an alcoholic.

499
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,255
And I used to do oxy.

500
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:23,391
I fell in love,

501
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:26,061
I thought, with an addict.

502
00:24:26,128 --> 00:24:28,629
Mm.

503
00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:32,767
I don't know why I said "I thought."

504
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:34,802
I mean...

505
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,905
I do.

506
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:40,908
It's because I'm not sure anymore

507
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:43,143
if I was actually in love with him, but...

508
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:46,512
to say that I wasn't feels cold,

509
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:48,648
because...

510
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:50,717
he's gone.

511
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:55,889
I woke up from this amazing high

512
00:24:55,957 --> 00:24:57,256
to find him dead.

513
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,394
And it didn't feel fair

514
00:25:02,462 --> 00:25:04,329
when I found out I was pregnant.

515
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,135
This baby...

516
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:12,871
our baby helped me stay clean.

517
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:15,540
Maybe it would've gotten him clean

518
00:25:15,608 --> 00:25:17,141
and we could've...

519
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,618
I don't know about being in love with him

520
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:30,421
because that time in my life...

521
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,355
the drugs...

522
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,660
I lived it, but...

523
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:42,666
it doesn't feel like my life.

524
00:25:42,734 --> 00:25:45,568
You loved him.

525
00:25:45,637 --> 00:25:49,538
We were sober together
for, like, five minutes.

526
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:52,274
If it felt like love, then it was.

527
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,443
Don't let the perspective you have now

528
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,612
diminish the feelings you had then.

529
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,948
That wouldn't be fair.

530
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:05,486
Have you ever been in love?

531
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:08,422
Couple times.

532
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,391
Not counting Halle Berry.

533
00:26:12,928 --> 00:26:15,063
What happened?

534
00:26:15,131 --> 00:26:16,230
With Halle?

535
00:26:16,298 --> 00:26:17,498
Mm-hmm.

536
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:18,633
I knew I wanted to see

537
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:20,400
more than Dickson County, Tennessee.

538
00:26:22,937 --> 00:26:25,139
I'd like to see it.

539
00:26:25,206 --> 00:26:26,874
When you got an hour, I'll show you.

540
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:44,423
Something just doesn't sit right.

541
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:47,126
It doesn't bother you that
there was only one lesion?

542
00:26:47,194 --> 00:26:48,327
Kaye?

543
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:49,628
Yeah.

544
00:26:49,697 --> 00:26:50,963
It would bother me if she were presenting

545
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,197
with more lesions or more seizures,

546
00:26:52,264 --> 00:26:54,099
but she's not.

547
00:26:56,035 --> 00:26:57,235
I don't know.

548
00:26:57,303 --> 00:27:00,005
Her titers were high, but not incredibly.

549
00:27:00,073 --> 00:27:03,942
Amelia, you did great for Kaye.

550
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,280
She's halfway to an Oscar as we speak.

551
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:12,750
Take the victory.

552
00:27:12,818 --> 00:27:13,918
Mm.

553
00:27:17,055 --> 00:27:18,155
This is a public service announcement

554
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:20,357
from the American soci...

555
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:22,059
Throws it out of bounds,
and that's gonna...

556
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:24,127
With happy dog dog chow...

557
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:27,530
Not this windbag again, please.

558
00:27:27,598 --> 00:27:29,833
How do you keep up with
what's going on in the world?

559
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,634
I read the paper.

560
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:33,970
Mm. Smarty-pants probably
has a subscription

561
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:35,271
to the "Times."

562
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:36,740
The "Journal."

563
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:39,442
I prefer objectivity in my news.

564
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:40,909
You're calling out

565
00:27:40,977 --> 00:27:42,778
one of the most esteemed
news publications in the world

566
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:44,312
for a lack of objectivity?

567
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,748
How can it be objective

568
00:27:45,815 --> 00:27:48,383
if all of its reporters are progressives?

569
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,921
Who did you vote for?

570
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:55,790
In the last presidential...

571
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,825
who did you vote for?

572
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,227
It's called a secret ballot,

573
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:00,962
and it's the foundation of our democracy.

574
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:02,529
You're a Republican.

575
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,031
Because I wouldn't tell
you who I voted for?

576
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,566
Because you ended a sentence with

577
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:07,168
"foundation of our democracy."

578
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:08,702
I'm a conservative.

579
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,304
- Just say you're a Republican.
- No.

580
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:11,639
- Why?
- Because you really, really want me to.

581
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:13,206
I'm in bed with a Republican.

582
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,540
I'm pretty sure it's not the first time.

583
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:16,488
Just think back to the
best sex you've ever had.

584
00:28:16,543 --> 00:28:17,944
Not funny.

585
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:19,045
- Deal breaker?
- Abortion?

586
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:21,081
- Pro-life.
 - The death penalty?

587
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:22,949
This is the sexiest pillow talk ever.

588
00:28:23,017 --> 00:28:25,185
Don't try to avoid it.

589
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:26,519
The Bible says "an eye for an eye."

590
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:27,953
Ohh!

591
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:30,589
All right, that logic drives me crazy!

592
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:31,924
You just said that you're for life,

593
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:33,025
but you're for the death penalty?

594
00:28:33,093 --> 00:28:35,261
I am for life... innocent life.

595
00:28:35,328 --> 00:28:37,362
Whose job is it to judge
innocence and guilt?

596
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,364
Does the person who took
Sarah Nelson deserve to live?

597
00:28:39,432 --> 00:28:40,833
Doesn't the Bible also say something about

598
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:41,646
turn the other cheek

599
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:43,868
and God's the only one who
can judge and stuff like that?

600
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:46,404
Wouldn't have pegged you as
someone who would quote scripture.

601
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:47,605
I did not quote scripture. I paraphrased.

602
00:28:47,673 --> 00:28:48,913
And everybody knows that stuff.

603
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:50,041
Ugh.

604
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:07,490
"You are capable of being a great leader."

605
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:09,193
So... I'm not, I guess.

606
00:29:11,362 --> 00:29:13,363
"You can't have rainbows without the rain."

607
00:29:15,266 --> 00:29:17,533
Is that insanely stupid
or incredibly profound?

608
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,468
It's a Dolly Parton quote.

609
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:22,205
I can't believe you know that.

610
00:29:22,272 --> 00:29:23,706
I'm not the one being seduced

611
00:29:23,773 --> 00:29:25,374
by the philosophies of Dolly Parton.

612
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:27,176
Okay, we weren't all bequeathed

613
00:29:27,244 --> 00:29:28,911
a subscription to the "Journal" at birth.

614
00:29:30,547 --> 00:29:32,814
How many other Alex P. Keatons
did your parents turn out?

615
00:29:32,882 --> 00:29:34,950
Just me.

616
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:38,119
I have, uh, three sisters

617
00:29:38,154 --> 00:29:40,588
and a brother who is as close to perfect

618
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:42,290
as a human can be.

619
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:44,860
People looking for a
higher power submit to him.

620
00:29:46,162 --> 00:29:48,830
When I look at you, all I see is perfect.

621
00:29:57,939 --> 00:30:00,207
My parents are coming into town.

622
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:02,243
Have dinner with us?

623
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,711
Yes.

624
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:08,782
This liberal heathen desperately
wants to meet your parents.

625
00:30:30,771 --> 00:30:33,739
The sun's coming up.

626
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:36,708
The sun is coming up.

627
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:57,111
Thank you.

628
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,814
Hey. Your parents get in all right?

629
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,482
At the hotel now.

630
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,851
I just wanted to check
in with you about tonight.

631
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,154
5:00 because they're on east coast time.

632
00:31:07,221 --> 00:31:08,721
That chain restaurant in the mall

633
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:10,557
because they're allergic
to new experiences.

634
00:31:10,624 --> 00:31:12,826
I mean, you're sure this is something

635
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:14,428
you're ready to do?

636
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:16,562
I... it's not like they'll
never be in L.A. again.

637
00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:17,930
Look, if you've changed your mind

638
00:31:17,998 --> 00:31:19,398
and you don't want me to meet them...

639
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,866
No, no, no, it's not that. It's...

640
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:22,734
What is it?

641
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:24,003
I dreamt last night

642
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:25,604
that the ceiling in the
restaurant collapsed.

643
00:31:25,672 --> 00:31:26,905
Everyone was all right,

644
00:31:26,974 --> 00:31:28,441
but... I don't know.

645
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:30,109
Meeting the folks is a big deal.

646
00:31:30,177 --> 00:31:32,243
Is this you freaking out?

647
00:31:32,311 --> 00:31:33,644
No.

648
00:31:33,712 --> 00:31:35,180
Yeah.

649
00:31:35,247 --> 00:31:36,448
Sort of. I think it is.

650
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:38,083
I'm your girlfriend,

651
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,786
and I am totally excited
to meet your parents.

652
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,792
I wanted them to experience L.A.

653
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,827
He took us to one of those restaurants

654
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:52,762
where they don't cook the food.

655
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,398
For my money,

656
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:56,900
you can't beat a restaurant
with an unlimited salad bar.

657
00:31:56,968 --> 00:31:58,335
Well, I wish they would put a limit

658
00:31:58,403 --> 00:31:59,603
on these cheese biscuits.

659
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,538
I am not gonna fit into my scrubs tomorrow.

660
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:03,572
That's a good one, Amelia.

661
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,808
You know, I was not expecting

662
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:07,377
to like you as much as I do.

663
00:32:07,444 --> 00:32:09,512
- Mom.
- No, I didn't mean it like that.

664
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:11,247
I just always envisioned that you would

665
00:32:11,315 --> 00:32:13,116
settle down somewhere near us

666
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:16,819
and marry a local gal.

667
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:19,021
Oh, let's, uh,

668
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:21,156
let's toast to new friends.

669
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:22,224
- New friends.
- Hear, hear.

670
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:23,492
New friends.

671
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,999
So, Amelia, do you have any siblings?

672
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:26,628
Three sisters, one brother.

673
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,063
All doctors.

674
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:29,731
Oh. Did your mother work?

675
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:32,667
Yeah, she was a nurse
in the Navy for 25 years.

676
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:34,503
Huh. That's probably where
y'all got the idea to be doctors.

677
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,702
Mm.

678
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,138
I teach English.

679
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,007
No idea where he got
an aptitude for science.

680
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:41,142
But I couldn't be prouder.

681
00:32:42,431 --> 00:32:44,098
Ah, I just direct traffic in the E.R.

682
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,132
Amelia's the genius at the table.

683
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,467
He's being modest.

684
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:47,701
The night we met, he
caught something I missed,

685
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:49,070
saved a man's life.

686
00:32:49,137 --> 00:32:50,338
Well, I'm not the least bit surprised,

687
00:32:50,405 --> 00:32:52,472
but then I might be a teeny bit biased.

688
00:32:54,075 --> 00:32:56,109
It is cool seeing the three
of you together as a family.

689
00:32:56,177 --> 00:32:57,810
You guys... get along really well.

690
00:32:57,878 --> 00:32:59,145
It's nice.

691
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:01,247
Well, that is so sweet of you to say, hon.

692
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:02,755
You know, I think it might have to do

693
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:04,250
with the fact that I was able

694
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,186
to be at home when he was growing up.

695
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:08,354
What kind of surgery do you practice?

696
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:09,455
- I'm a neurosurgeon.
- Oh.

697
00:33:09,522 --> 00:33:10,889
Amelia.

698
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:13,058
Your job sounds as hard
as... rocket science.

699
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,862
Is that something you
could ever do part-time?

700
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:18,330
Mom, we talked about this.

701
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:20,099
Why would I do the thing I love part-time?

702
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:23,868
Well, I was thinking, if you
ever want to have children...

703
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,636
- I won't quit working.
- Amelia, you don't have to answer.

704
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,105
Mom, now is not the time.

705
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,374
I am just making polite conversation.

706
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,574
It's okay. I can answer.

707
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:32,143
She promised not to interrogate you.

708
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:34,578
- Well, it's not an interrogation.
- You see?

709
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,081
I just want to make sure
that you're taken care of.

710
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:39,549
Mom, not the place, not the time,

711
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,018
not your business.

712
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,486
Let's move on.

713
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,223
Well, I'm gonna have the chicken parmesan.

714
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,324
Ooh, that does sound good.

715
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,558
It's always good.

716
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,793
How about I get the francaise, this one?

717
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:52,429
It has that mushrooms and zucchini.

718
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,331
I like zucchini.

719
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,065
I'd say it went pretty well.

720
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:58,067
You mean once I kept my mouth shut.

721
00:33:58,135 --> 00:34:00,036
Well, she promised to play nice,
but you know how mothers are.

722
00:34:00,103 --> 00:34:01,870
I wasn't talking about her.
I was talking about you.

723
00:34:01,938 --> 00:34:03,339
You cut me off.

724
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:04,740
I stopped her from asking you

725
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:06,175
about things we haven't discussed yet.

726
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:07,410
It was like you didn't think

727
00:34:07,477 --> 00:34:08,944
that I had ideas about my own life.

728
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:10,746
Or you didn't trust me
to talk to your mother.

729
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:12,247
I'm sorry if that's the way it came across.

730
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:13,714
It's just my mother I don't trust.

731
00:34:13,782 --> 00:34:15,783
You know what? I will not be
treated like a little child

732
00:34:15,851 --> 00:34:17,552
who needs to be silenced, all right?

733
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:19,387
This is not working.

734
00:34:19,455 --> 00:34:21,989
What are you talking about?

735
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:23,379
Wait. Are you breaking up with me?

736
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:25,093
You need to go.

737
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:26,961
I'm not going anywhere. We're
just having an argument here.

738
00:34:27,029 --> 00:34:28,128
Go.

739
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:29,296
No.

740
00:34:29,364 --> 00:34:30,664
Fine.

741
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:33,867
Amelia.

742
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:49,182
Are you awake?

743
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:51,684
I'm awake.

744
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:54,220
I might be hallucinating, but I'm awake.

745
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:55,654
I don't want to bother you.

746
00:34:55,722 --> 00:34:56,962
I've been laying here for weeks.

747
00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:59,357
Everything's a bother.

748
00:34:59,425 --> 00:35:00,792
You look like death warmed over.

749
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:02,627
Thanks, Heidi Klum.

750
00:35:02,695 --> 00:35:04,062
Mm. I got a headache

751
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,064
that would put Godzilla
in a fetal position.

752
00:35:06,132 --> 00:35:08,900
I don't know if it's noon
or a quarter to midnight

753
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:12,504
or, well, 1976.

754
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:14,306
It's 2:00 A.M.

755
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:15,473
What the hell are you doing here?

756
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,074
I couldn't fall asleep in the on-call room.

757
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:18,209
You on call?

758
00:35:18,276 --> 00:35:19,843
No. I...

759
00:35:21,813 --> 00:35:23,514
James and I had a fight.

760
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:25,616
He's still at my apartment,

761
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:27,151
which, in an act of
sheer freakin' brilliance,

762
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:28,452
I stormed out of.

763
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:31,088
Who storms out of their own apartment?

764
00:35:31,155 --> 00:35:33,356
Ugh. I'm so embarrassed.

765
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:36,025
I mean, I... I was just
trying to stand up for myself,

766
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:37,594
and now...

767
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:39,529
Oh, God. I'm so humiliated.

768
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:41,297
I can't go back.

769
00:35:41,365 --> 00:35:44,000
I just... I wanted...

770
00:35:45,902 --> 00:35:47,636
I just need to sit with someone.

771
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:50,005
Sit.

772
00:36:24,942 --> 00:36:26,009
- Hey.
- Hey.

773
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:27,143
Late night with James?

774
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,810
Mm. Something like that.

775
00:36:28,878 --> 00:36:30,646
So it's going well?

776
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:32,648
Things are fine.

777
00:36:32,715 --> 00:36:34,082
Why do I get the feeling

778
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,551
there's something you're not telling me?

779
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:37,819
Why don't you get the feeling
that I don't want to talk?

780
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:40,022
I don't need a shrink.

781
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:42,157
I didn't need a matchmaker either,

782
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:44,926
but that did not stop you
from shoving dates in my face

783
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:46,761
in some quest for true love

784
00:36:46,828 --> 00:36:49,630
that I did not even remotely
hint at being interested in.

785
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,101
Just let it go.

786
00:36:55,637 --> 00:36:57,271
Sorry.

787
00:36:58,506 --> 00:36:59,773
Oh.

788
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,241
No. Uh...

789
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:04,711
I'm sorry.

790
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:06,245
I didn't get much sleep last night.

791
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:07,948
No, you're right.

792
00:37:08,015 --> 00:37:09,415
You are right.

793
00:37:09,483 --> 00:37:11,685
I've been spending a lot of
time on my couch alone, too.

794
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:14,654
And the thing is...

795
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:19,157
I'm not a young woman.

796
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:22,795
I mean, I know, I still got it, but...

797
00:37:22,862 --> 00:37:25,197
I'm not young.

798
00:37:25,264 --> 00:37:27,833
So sometimes I think

799
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:29,935
maybe...

800
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:33,838
I will spend the rest of my life alone.

801
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:41,879
I have to go the hospital.

802
00:37:46,752 --> 00:37:50,621
Violet, you can call me.

803
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:55,025
We can hang out in the
couch in sweats together.

804
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:05,167
I got the page.

805
00:38:05,235 --> 00:38:06,368
What happened?

806
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:07,870
Another seizure.

807
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:09,939
I know. I'm taking her for
a C.T. to see what happened.

808
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:11,608
I thought you said the lesions were gone.

809
00:38:11,642 --> 00:38:12,842
They were.

810
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:15,011
We'll figure this out, Kaye. We will.

811
00:38:15,078 --> 00:38:17,212
Please. I can't... what's wrong with me?

812
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,781
I'll take it from here.

813
00:38:18,849 --> 00:38:21,616
Glad you're okay. I was worried.

814
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,728
You okay?

815
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:37,330
Do I deserve someone?

816
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,598
Amelia, of course.

817
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,167
I mean, why... why do you...

818
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,203
Because I don't know if
James and I can't work

819
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:46,239
or if don't want us to.

820
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:48,976
I mean, at the end of the
day, I'm a recovering addict

821
00:38:49,044 --> 00:38:50,844
with a dump truck full of baggage, right?

822
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,279
And the worst tragedy
that has ever struck James

823
00:38:53,346 --> 00:38:55,548
is having to put down his golden retriever.

824
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:57,249
You're not giving him any credit.

825
00:38:57,317 --> 00:38:59,185
He's an E.R. doctor, right?
He's... he's seen things.

826
00:38:59,252 --> 00:39:01,954
Sure. Other people's tragedies.

827
00:39:02,022 --> 00:39:03,422
That does not prepare someone

828
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,125
to live with crazy day in and day out.

829
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:09,961
He's a Republican.

830
00:39:15,234 --> 00:39:16,467
Do you even vote?

831
00:39:16,535 --> 00:39:17,736
That is not the point.

832
00:39:17,804 --> 00:39:19,404
I don't think you're seeing the point.

833
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:22,007
You've been so strong this past year.

834
00:39:22,075 --> 00:39:23,541
And there's no doubt in my mind

835
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:24,909
that if you wanted to work
through this, you could.

836
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:26,711
But what you're not seeing,

837
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:30,581
and what I didn't really
see until recently is,

838
00:39:30,648 --> 00:39:32,950
none of it matters.

839
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:35,452
The petty things that we argue about

840
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,640
and wish we could change
about the other person, it...

841
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:42,593
you want to know the
only thing that matters?

842
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,862
If someone will hold your
hand when you have cancer.

843
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,931
Sheldon...

844
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,433
It's prostate, and I'm fine.

845
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,670
Well... I hope I'm gonna be fine.

846
00:39:53,738 --> 00:39:55,939
But I... I've never been happier

847
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:59,542
because I've found someone
who'll hold my hand.

848
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:02,245
And trust me, that is...

849
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:04,513
that's all that matters.

850
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:29,070
So...

851
00:40:29,138 --> 00:40:30,772
what was that fight really about?

852
00:40:34,676 --> 00:40:37,211
All the men I care about die.

853
00:40:40,048 --> 00:40:42,116
My people live a long time.

854
00:40:43,518 --> 00:40:46,486
I have an Uncle who's
103. Smokes 2 packs a day.

855
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:54,060
Amelia, I love you.

856
00:40:57,765 --> 00:40:59,166
It's her heart.

857
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:00,700
What?

858
00:41:00,768 --> 00:41:02,634
Kaye.

859
00:41:02,702 --> 00:41:05,304
The single lesion, the...
the lack of clusters,

860
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:07,706
the... the titers that...
that aren't that high...

861
00:41:07,774 --> 00:41:11,010
It's her heart. There's
something in her heart.

862
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:13,712
She could be throwing emboli
that are causing her to seize.

863
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:19,083
Echo confirmed a tumor in
the left atrium of her heart.

864
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:20,285
What does that mean?

865
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,220
As the tumor broke apart, you threw emboli,

866
00:41:22,288 --> 00:41:23,487
and one went to your brain.

867
00:41:23,555 --> 00:41:24,755
That's what caused the lesion.

868
00:41:24,756 --> 00:41:26,124
And subsequently, the seizures.

869
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,725
Lifesaving catch, Dr. Shepherd.

870
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:28,993
You're in good hands.

871
00:41:29,061 --> 00:41:30,295
Dr. Bennett's gonna get the tumor.

872
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,696
You're gonna be up and running in no time.

873
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:33,263
Gonna be a hell of a
story to tell at auditions.

874
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:35,098
Save it for Kimmel.

875
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:41,004
Todd Reiter.

876
00:41:41,072 --> 00:41:42,806
Your first night,

877
00:41:42,874 --> 00:41:44,007
crazy night in the E.R.

878
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:45,575
Spinal infection.

879
00:41:45,643 --> 00:41:49,078
I told you to discharge, and you didn't.

880
00:41:49,146 --> 00:41:50,346
Yeah?

881
00:41:51,548 --> 00:41:52,748
Everything we know,

882
00:41:52,816 --> 00:41:56,552
all the knowledge that we have...

883
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,788
pros, cons,

884
00:41:59,857 --> 00:42:02,391
probable causes, likely diagnosis,

885
00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:04,727
years of schooling,

886
00:42:04,794 --> 00:42:05,994
and it still comes down to instincts,

887
00:42:06,062 --> 00:42:08,864
and sometimes, all signs
point one way, but...

888
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:12,567
but sometimes you just gotta
get in your car and drive...

889
00:42:12,634 --> 00:42:13,634
and forget that you know

890
00:42:13,702 --> 00:42:15,036
what failing looks like.

891
00:42:16,072 --> 00:42:17,973
What are you...

892
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,407
I love you, too.
