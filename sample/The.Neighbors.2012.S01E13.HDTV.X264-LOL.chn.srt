00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,950
你是唯一赞同我的人
You're the only one who agrees with me.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,390
可不是嘛 我也超不懂吸血鬼那套的
Yeah. I don't get the vampire thing, either.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,770
他们总是板着个脸
They're all in such bad moods.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,600
是啊 都闷闷不乐的
I know. They're so mopey.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,860
就像是 反正你们死不了
It's like, so you're undead.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,050
高兴点 去晒晒太阳 是不?
Cheer up and get a tan, am I right?

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,440
没错
You are right.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,320
- 你不错嘛 - 是么
- That was good. - Yeah?

9
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,370
和我教你的一样
Just like I showed you.

10
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,290
- 那琥珀... - 真有你的 韦弗
- So, Amber... - Well done, Weaver.

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,160
谢了
Thank you.

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,290
她们什么意思?
What was that for?

13
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,560
没事 你刚说什么?
Nothing. Um, what were you saying?

14
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,310
我最近一直听人谈论即将到来的舞会
I've been hearing quite a bit of talk about an upcoming dance.

15
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,260
然后呢?
Yeah?

16
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,470
然后我想问你
And I was wondering if...

17
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,590
是否愿意...
You would...

18
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,050
哇 琥珀 不错嘛
Wow, Amber, nice score.

19
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,220
十分感谢
Thank you so much.

20
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,070
抱歉 我刚分心了
Sorry. I'm totally distracted.

21
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,600
杰里米邀请我去舞会
Jeremy asked me to the dance.

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,430
我知道 难以置信
I know. It's crazy.

23
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,490
每个女生都想被他邀请 结果他邀请了我
Every girl wanted him to ask her, and he asked me.

24
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,810
我有种戴安娜王妃...才会有的那种感觉
I feel like princess Diana... Would have felt

25
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,140
如果查尔斯王子不是近亲结婚的小孩
if prince Charles wasn't the product of inbreeding.

26
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,560
你怎么在这?
Why are you here right now?

27
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,860
最好你是来给奶奶报丧的
Grandma had better be dead.

28
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,210
很遗憾 奶奶活得好好的
Grandma's fine, sadly.

29
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,620
那你在这究竟是个什么情况?
What is it that you could possibly be doing?

30
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,500
我和爸爸是一起来报名做舞会监护人
I'm signing your father and myself up as chaperones for the dance.

31
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,080
那我就报名参军 去阿富汗
Well, then I'm signing up for the army. Afghanistan.

32
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,200
做拆雷的工兵 成吗?
I'm going to be a minesweeper. Deal?

33
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,520
我知道这对你来说很糟
I know this is horrible for you,

34
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,920
但我还是义无反顾
but I'm doing it anyway,

35
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,660
因为你爸和我是在舞会相遇的
because your father and I met at a dance,

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,560
所以我想去 我也有权这么做
and I want to, and I deserve to get something I want.

37
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,770
但我允许你对我们约法三章
But I will allow you to give us three guidelines.

38
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,640
别站我旁边 别跟我对视
No standing near me, no looking at me,

39
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,510
别跳舞 就这么多
no dancing, period.

40
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,850
- 那要... - 韦氏独舞也不行
- Even... - That includes the Weaver running man.

41
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,480
很好 成交
All right. Done.

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,290
尽管你的父亲会万分失望
Although your father will be disappointed.

43
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,520
要是你破了我的约法三章
If you break any of my rules,

44
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,310
我就和杰里米大尺度亲热
I will make out with Jeremy so hard,

45
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,160
当着你的面
so in front of you,

46
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,640
让你无法直视 甚至闭上眼都会脑补出
you won't be able to close your eyes without picturing

47
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,560
别的小伙手在你闺女的丰臀上缠绵
some guy's hand groping your daughter's butt.

48
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,570
也许你会幻想沙滩
You'll try to think of the beach,

49
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,950
或是开心事助你安眠
or something happy so you can sleep.

50
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,090
但你总是事与愿违
But you won't be able to.

51
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,550
他的十指
His hands.

52
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,400
我的丰臀
My butt.

53
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,350
缠绵整晚
All night.

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,710
我想我们都会玩得开心的
I think we'll all have a great time.

55
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,670
是啊 应该不错
Yeah. It should be good.

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,870
再见了 亲爱的
Bye, sunshine.

57
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,600
- 噢 - 天啊
- Oh. - Man.

58
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,310
礼服闪亮登场
Now this is a suit.

59
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,670
那腹带湛蓝如你的眼睛
The cummerbund was the same blue as your eyes...

60
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,440
还有我的眼影
And my eye shadow.

61
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,450
你们是说高中舞会
Now you were saying that high school dances

62
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,250
不仅仅只是跳舞喽?
are not just about dancing?

63
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,470
没错 它们更像是爱情作战区
Right. They're kind of like a love war zone.

64
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,710
有伤心的 追求的 拒绝的
There's heartbreak, pursuit, rejection...

65
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,180
太多拒绝了
So much rejection.

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
我和马蒂的那次舞会就包含了所有元素
And at this dance, Marty and I had the whole shebang.

67
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,710
那是一个充斥眼泪与戏剧化的夜晚
It was a night of drama and tears,

68
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,200
好在最后我们意识到
but in the end, we realized...

69
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,690
- 我们是天作之合 - 多费劲啊
- We were soul mates. - How exhausting.

70
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,260
为什么不直接跳过前戏
Why wouldn't you skip all that first part?

71
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,490
有时要先行之
Well, sometimes you have to get it wrong

72
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,030
才知此路不可行嘛
before you get it right, you know?

73
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,080
事实上是 我们不这样
Actually, we don't.

74
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,760
察布隆人完美把握了
Zabvronians are so perfectly in tune

75
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,690
宇宙真理 绝不会走错路
with the universal truth that we don't get it wrong.

76
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,720
到了两人寻觅伴侣的时候
When it is time for two beings to find each other,

77
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,110
难以抵抗的力量会让我们伸出脚
we are pulled onto our feet by an intractable force

78
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,980
无论他们身在何处
and the same thing is happening to our mate,

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,910
我们的伴侣也会做出同样的动作
wherever they may be.

80
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,890
随后我们被这力量牵引到神圣之地
Hmm. And we are pulled by this force to a nearby holy space

81
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,610
也就是你们所谓的爱的田野
which you call a love field.

82
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,030
不 我们没有这说法
Oh, no. We don't call anything a love field.

83
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,080
- 没有吗? - 没有
- No? - No.

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,920
随便了 我们就是这样相遇
Well, anyway, that's how we meet,

85
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,770
然后 我们就一起永远幸福快乐地生活着
and from that moment forward, we are together and in harmony for all eternity.

86
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,740
也不总是幸...
Well, not always in har...

87
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,090
- 永远幸福快乐地生活 - 抱歉
- In harmony for all eternity. - Sorry.

88
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,610
我不确定会喜欢那么简单
Well, I wonder if I'd like it being that easy.

89
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,480
约会过程的纠结 "会不会在一起" 
The whole drama of dating, the "will-they-won't-they?"

90
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,450
这才是高中舞会的精髓所在
That's what high school dances are all about.

91
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,750
还有超炫的礼服
Well, that and the cool suit.

92
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,800
他还留着他的呢
Oh, he still has his.

93
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,230
你想看吗 拉里? 过来
You wanna see it, Larry? Come on.

94
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,810
我真心只是来给你送报纸的
I honestly just wanted to bring your newspaper

95
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,050
然后就回...噢 每次我都被困住
and go ho... oh. I always get sucked in.

96
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,430
黛比・韦弗
Debbie Weaver,

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,910
你能再跟我多说说你和真命天子马蒂如何相遇的吗?
will you tell me more about how you met your soul mate Marty?

98
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,330
让我们调点儿含羞草酒一起翻翻毕业纪念册吧?
Let's make mimosas and find the yearbooks, huh?

99
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,050
她行动快捷 很放松
She's pretty fast and loose

100
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,100
- 借着调含羞草酒的借口... - 嘘 嘘 嘘
- with the excuses for mimosas... - Shh, shh, shh.

101
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,180
噢 这简直太棒了
Oh. This is so great.

102
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,310
我当时的舞伴是格雷格・泰西
Greg tansey was my date.

103
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,510
等一下 马蒂不是你的舞伴?
Wait. Marty wasn't your date?

104
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,460
不是啊 我们和别人约会 事情是这样的
No. We went with other people. That's the story.

105
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,800
- 噢 - 格雷格开车来接我
- Oh. - So Greg picks me up

106
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,150
用那辆从他老爸那借来的酷车
in this really cool car he borrowed from his dad.

107
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,870
超梦幻
Totally dreamy.

108
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,080
- 他戴着华丽丽的腕花来敲门 - 胸衣?
- He comes to the door with the perfect corsage. - Corsage?

109
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,080
corsage也有胸衣之意

110
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,800
噢 那是一种绕在手腕的花
Oh, it's a flower you strap to your wrist.

111
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,410
男孩子邀请女孩子去舞会时用的
It's what boys bring girls for dances.

112
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,660
手腕花环? 听起来真搞
A wrist flower? That sounds preposterous,

113
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,410
- 不过现在还蛮想要一个的 - 是吧?
- and yet now I really want one. - Right?

114
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,730
噢 我很激动 但是...
Oh, I was so excited. But then...

115
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,970
他爽约了 但是马蒂
He stood you up. But Marty,

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,560
住在你隔壁 有着更酷发型的马蒂
who lived next door and had much better hair,

117
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,150
带你去了?
took you anyway?

118
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,550
不 我和格雷格去了舞会
No. Greg and I went to the dance.

119
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,620
但是他和他哥们儿去玩了
But he runs off to hang with his guy friends,

120
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,980
把我一个人留在那儿
totally leaving me alone.

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,250
我很尴尬
I was so embarrassed.

122
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,910
飙着泪跑了出去
I burst into tears and ran outside.

123
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,080
虽然我知道一定会没事的
I know it's all going to be fine,

124
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,480
但是还是禁不住心头一紧
but I'm still so nervous that it won't be.

125
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,170
我打起精神
So I pulled myself together,

126
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,980
走进去给自己拿了杯饮料
and I go inside to get myself a glass of punch.

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
而站在饮料台旁边的就是...
And standing by the punch bowl is...

128
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,690
格雷格・泰西的爸爸 他来要回他的车
Greg tansey's father. He wanted his car back.

129
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,690
不 是马蒂
No. Marty.

130
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,370
他和那个垃圾女孩参加舞会
He had gone to the dance with this trashy girl,

131
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,450
丽萨・小脆饼
Lisa Biscotti.

132
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,730
他们也处得不是很愉快
And they were having a horrible time, too.

133
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,660
所以他递了我一杯饮料
So he poured me a glass of punch,

134
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,370
我立刻被逗乐了
had me laughing right away.

135
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,770
我本打算只聊个三五分钟
I thought we spoke for five minutes.

136
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,170
但最后我们聊了一个小时
It ended up being almost an hour.

137
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,950
恋爱时时光飞逝如梭啊
Time flew because you were in love.

138
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,980
没错
Exactly.

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,760
所以我们决定和各自的舞伴分开
So we decided to break it off with our dates,

140
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,040
我们走向舞池
we met on the dance floor,

141
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,010
他把我拉入怀中
he pulled me in close,

142
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,950
和着"织梦者"的歌曲共舞
and we danced to "Dream Weaver."

143
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,930
就是你的名字啊
Which is your name.

144
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,580
太完美了 你的名字在这首歌里出现了
It was perfect, because your name is in the song.

145
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,370
你开始上道了
You are getting it now.

146
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,870
这就是我为什么想做这次的舞会监护人的原因
That's why I want to chaperone this dance, you know?

147
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,754
有的时候 能有件事儿提醒我们
Sometimes it's nice to have a reminder

148
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:25,220
一切是如何开始的也挺好
of where it all started.

149
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,400
我觉得高中舞会
I think a high school dance

150
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,960
就是世界上最激动人心和浪漫的地方
sounds like the most exciting, romantic place in the world.

151
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,750
让我们一起看约翰・休斯的舞会电影
Let's watch John Hughes movies about dances

152
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,750
上世纪九十年代好莱坞知名青春片导演

153
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,060
再喝些含羞草酒吧
and make more mimosas.

154
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,140
事实上不过是橘子汁
They're mostly orange juice.

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,570
我觉得她没有喝多 真的
I think she has it under control. I really do.

156
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,480
夫君 我想要个"会不会在一起"
Husband, I want a "will-they-won't-they."

157
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,420
好的 在亚马逊下个单
Fine. Order one on Amazon.

158
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,700
- 你可以用我的信用卡 - 不
- You can put it on the credit card. - No.

159
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,850
我想要个你赢得我芳心的梦幻故事
I want a dramatic story about how you won me.

160
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,220
我们在一起的过程太随便了
The way we got together was so easy.

161
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,050
太无聊了
So boring.

162
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,700
噢 没错 宇宙让我们走到了一起
Oh, yes. The universe drew us together

163
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,540
超越时间和空间成就的完美结合
through space and time to a perfect union.

164
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,420
多么无聊的事儿啊
What a snooze festival.

165
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,800
我想要的是曲折的故事 不舍的追求
I want drama, pursuit.

166
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,110
我要你追求我
I want you to chase me.

167
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,180
- 怎么? 追去厨房? - 只是打个比方
- What, into the kitchen? - Metaphorically.

168
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,270
你想让我打个比方追你到厨房?
You want me to metaphorically chase you into the kitchen?

169
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,270
我希望经历百转千回之后 你才赢得我的芳心
I want you to win me after a twisty, turny story

170
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,880
虽然看起来你不会
where it seems like you won't,

171
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,590
带着满满的失望和腕上的花
filled with disappointment and wrist flowers,

172
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,010
之后 当我以为就这样的时候
and then, just when all is lost,

173
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,890
一辆梦幻的轿车
a dreamy car.

174
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,140
但是我已经赢得你了
But I already won you.

175
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,390
- 是吗? - 我没有吗?
- Have you? - Have I?

176
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,980
噢 不是这样的
Oh, that's not how you do it.

177
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,770
我现在会马上冲出去
I'm going to storm out dramatically.

178
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,790
噢 亲爱的 别开玩笑了!
Oh, darling, don't be ridiculous!

179
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,570
你要带我去舞会!
You're taking me to that dance!

180
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,570
噢...拜托 小南瓜!
Oh... come on, pumpkin!

181
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,030
啊 估计这就是我这周的活儿了
Ugh. I guess this is what I'm doing this week.

182
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,230
你好 我是雷吉
Hello. I'm Reggie.

183
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,480
我注意到你好像朋友不是很多
I noticed you don't have any friends

184
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,090
很可能在为舞伴而烦恼
and might be desperate for a date.

185
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,430
是的 我是吉塞尔...
That's true. I'm Giselle...

186
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,420
- 和那个模特名字一样 - 棒极了
- Like the model. - Great.

187
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,420
吉赛尔・邦辰: 巴西性感超模

188
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,790
我最近才学到了找到灵魂伴侣的方法
So I recently learned that the way you find your soul mate

189
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,050
便是和错的人一起去参加舞会
is to go to the dance with the wrong person,

190
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,720
当你在饮料台帮找到灵魂伴侣之后就和她分手
who you then break up with after you find your soul mate at the punch bowl.

191
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,420
所以我在想
So I was wondering,

192
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,720
你愿不愿意当我那个错的人
would you like to be my wrong person,

193
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,200
我要甩的那个人?
the one I will dump?

194
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,610
我们能去我父母的房子照个像么?
Can we still take pictures at my parents' house?

195
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,390
可以
Sure.

196
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,350
好的 太棒了
Okay. Awesome.

197
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,540
你可以去看看我的乌龟
You can meet my turtle.

198
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,530
听起来有点怪 不过我八点来接你
That's weird, but I'll pick you up at 8:00.

199
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,060
好的
Okay.

200
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,640
你的舞伴来了
Your date has arrived.

201
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,060
亲爱的 你太美了
Oh, honey, you look beautiful.

202
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,460
我还配了水钻
I even pulled out the rhinestones.

203
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,570
到晚上 我将会光彩照人
My neck will be green by 10:00.

204
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,940
噢 对了...
Oh, oh. And...

205
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,170
我给你准备了胸花
I got you a boutonniere.

206
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,650
你还给我准备了这个啊
You got me flowers?

207
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,440
我没想到我们需要这大费周章
I didn't realize we were going all out.

208
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,900
我要去换套正装么? 我可以...
You want me to wear the suit? I could...

209
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,660
不用 你已经很帅了
No, you look handsome.

210
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,120
很好 我也不想整晚都收着腹
Good, 'cause I don't think I can hold my stomach in all night.

211
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,440
抱一个
Come here.

212
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,640
好吧 这种搂搂抱抱的事
Okay. This whole touching each other thing,

213
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,160
今晚别再做了
this is the last of that.

214
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,790
- 哇 - 噢 她美得像个天使
- Wow. - Oh, she's an angel.

215
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,670
我们今晚的谈话也就到此为止了
And thus ends our talking for the night.

216
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,550
杰里米到了吗?
Is Jeremy outside?

217
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,940
让他进来坐坐吧 我们想跟他聊聊
Bring him in here. We wanna meet him.

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,490
- 对了 我们照张相吧 - 马上
- Oh, I need pictures. - Right.

219
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,690
那你们还不如借个哈勃太空望远镜
Well, then you'd better borrow someone's hubble telescope,

220
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,070
这样你才能看清楚我们的一举一动
because that's as close as you're going to get to us.

221
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,310
- 就一张 - 不行
- Just one. - No.

222
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,220
- 就一张你和我的? - 没门
- Just one of me and you? - Not happening.

223
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,970
- 马蒂 马蒂 快拍照 - 马上 马上
- Marty, Marty, take a picture. - Almost. Almost.

224
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,400
- 好的 - 快快快
- Okay. - Now. Now. Now.

225
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,050
快
Now.

226
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,050
没拍到 只有门
Nope. All door.

227
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,710
噢 希望她玩得开心
Oh, I hope she has fun.

228
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,940
我希望今晚是个梦幻之夜
I hope it's magical.

229
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,680
我倒希望只是柏拉图式的
Well, I hope it's platonic.

230
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,670
也希望杰里米被阉了
And I hope that Jeremy's a eunuch.

231
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,930
到时是我们去接他们 还是他们自己回来?
Are we picking them up, or are they gonna meet us here?

232
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,000
什么? 谁? 你在说什么?
What? Who them? What are you talking about?

233
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,710
你们几个 不要激动
Guys? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

234
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,040
- 有话好好说 - 不许动粗!
- Break it up. - No roughhousing!

235
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,590
哪凉快哪呆着去!
Take it to the shower where it belongs!

236
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,980
走吧 走吧
Go. Go.

237
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,200
如果他们只是想自己出来玩玩
If the boys just wanted to hang out with each other,

238
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,530
那还带上我们干嘛?
why did they even bring us?

239
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,370
我也不知道
I have no idea.

240
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,190
这里太好玩了
Well, I'm so glad I came.

241
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,170
但是拉里 杰西看起来有点不开心
You know what, though, Larry? Jackie seems a little upset.

242
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,860
我认为你该过去和她聊聊
You should go talk to her, I think.

243
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,560
噢 不用 别担心 我懂我妻
Oh, no. Don't worry. I know my wife.

244
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,230
你知道我们该干什么吗?
You know what we should do?

245
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,490
我们该到孩子们抽烟的地方去
Let's go outside where the kids smoke

246
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,820
然后唬得他们像蟑螂一样四处窜
and watch 'em scatter like cockroaches.

247
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,120
噢 马蒂・韦弗 你真有趣
Oh, Marty Weaver, you are fun.

248
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,080
- 你也有趣 - 哥们 别逼我动手
- You're fun! - Don't you start with me, big boy.

249
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,700
- 那你想和我打? - 你想试试 是吧 哥们?
- Oh, you wanna start with me? - Oh, you wanna start something, do you, big boy?

250
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,140
是的 我就是想和你试试 我现在就要和你试试
Yeah, I wanna start with you. I'm gonna start with you.

251
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,830
有时候想吸引他们还真难
Sometimes it's hard to stay attracted to them.

252
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,240
太难了
So hard.

253
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,360
太有趣了...星期一和星期三
It's interesting... mondays and wednesdays,

254
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,910
我做上肢运动 星期二和星期四
I do upper bod, Tuesdays and Thursdays,

255
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,820
我做下肢运动 星期五是有氧运动
I do lower. Fridays are cardio.

256
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,200
今天坐下蹲的时候 我突然想到...
But today, I was doing squats, when I realized...

257
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,720
今天是星期五啊
It's Friday.

258
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,330
然后怎样呢?
So what'd you do?

259
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,960
改成有氧运动呗
Switched to cardio.

260
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,350
真不敢相信他是你的舞伴
I can't believe that he's your date.

261
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,640
她是他的舞伴
She's his date.

262
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,700
能留下你号码么
I should get your number.

263
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,640
我现在就想给你发短信
I'm gonna start texting you now.

264
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,460
天哪
Oh, my.

265
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,410
这里布置得好迷人 是吗?
It really is quite magical, isn't it?

266
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,660
这儿真美
It's nice.

267
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,950
有时我会点起几根蜡烛 坐到衣橱里
Sometimes I light candles and sit in my closet.

268
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,370
这样也不错哦
It's nice, too.

269
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
好吧
Okay.

270
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,790
我要去饮料台旁等我的真爱了
I'm going to the punch bowl to wait for my soul mate.

271
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,210
我可以站在你身边吗?
Can I stand near you?

272
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,720
还是你希望我保持距离?
Or would you like me to keep my distance?

273
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,160
吉塞尔...
Giselle...

274
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,230
还是保持距离吧
Keep your distance.

275
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,580
天哪 今晚太棒了
Oh, my God. That was awesome.

276
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,880
姑娘们 你们错过精彩部分了 
Girls, you missed it.

277
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:52,160
我们去追那几个拿着酒瓶的孩子
We chased down these kids with a flask.

278
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,120
他们还想跳过灌木丛逃走
They tried to get away by jumping over these bushes,

279
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,570
但摔了个狗吃屎
but they fell in face-first.

280
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,450
还血迹斑斑的
There was blood.

281
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,810
当舞会监护人的感觉真棒
I love chaperoning.

282
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,040
一部讲述青少年恋爱的喜剧电影

283
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,040
夫君! 我想要《美丽粉色》里的情节
Husband! I want to be "pretty in pinked,"

284
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,520
现在就要
and I want it now.

285
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,320
可你彻底搞砸了
You're completely dropping the ball.

286
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,210
你这么说可不对 我觉得我表现得挺好的
Oh, I disagree. I think I'm doing great.

287
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,460
你连腕花都没给我准备一个
You didn't even give me a wrist flower.

288
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,750
我为什么要为你弄死自己的花?
Why would I kill one of my flowers for you?

289
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,720
因为你想得到我
Because you are trying to get me.

290
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,550
我们都是老夫老妻了
But I already have you.

291
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,550
拉里 你应该追过去
Larry, you should go after her.

292
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,850
如我所言 我懂我妻 现在还不是时候
Like I said, I know my wife. Now is not the time.

293
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,650
快 有人在舞池内有不当举动!
Oh! Below-the-waist touching on the dance floor!

294
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,360
我马上过来
I'll be with you in a sec.

295
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,140
太疯狂了 他今晚挺高兴的
Crazy. He's having fun.

296
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,470
那你能陪你的舞伴一会儿吗 哪怕一分钟?
So, think you could hang with your date for, like, a minute?

297
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,300
等一下 你是真的生气了吗?
Wait, are you... you really mad at me?

298
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,920
我以为只是出来做监护 原来你是当约会啊?
I thought we were chaperoning. Is this a date?

299
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,640
好吧 是的
Well, yeah.

300
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,010
我想重温我们坠入爱河的那晚
I wanted to relive the night we fell in love.

301
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,950
那我去看看D.J.有没有那首"织梦者"
How about I go see if the D.J. has "Dream Weaver,"

302
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,220
然后你和你家老头跳一支啊
and then you give your old man a dance,

303
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,300
我还记得一些时髦的动作哦
because I still have some funky moves.

304
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,820
- 噢 真的? - 真的 想看吗?
- Oh, you do? - Yeah, you wanna see?

305
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,800
- 跳跳咯 - 想看?
- Let's see. - Wanna see it?

306
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,080
- 记得这个不? - 噢 我喜欢的 
- Remember this one? - Oh. I like it.

307
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,640
当我用手这样动的时候 你喜欢吗?
You like this, when I do this with the arms?

308
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,570
这个姿势?
The attitude?

309
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,790
天啊 完了 停 停下
Oh, my God. Stop. Stop.

310
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,650
- 去拿点喝的给我 -好吧 
- Go get me some punch. - All right.

311
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,430
好吧 马上回来
All right, be right back.

312
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,830
嗨 雷吉 你在干嘛呢?
Hey, Reggie, what are you doing?

313
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,700
黛比・韦弗告诉过我
Debbie Weaver told me

314
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,200
如何在饮料台旁与他们的灵魂伴侣邂逅
about how humans meet their soul mates by the punch bowl.

315
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,990
然后我就在这里了
So I'm here.

316
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,450
不 兄弟 这只是我和黛比的邂逅过程
No, buddy, that's just how Debbie and I got together.

317
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,020
不是每个人的邂逅过程
That's not everybody's story.

318
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,670
所以我很迷茫
So I am so confused.

319
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,080
那我和我的灵魂伴侣邂逅的故事是什么?
What's my soul mate story?

320
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,940
哥们 不要让女人控制你的理智吗?
Buddy, don't let the ladies get into your head, okay?

321
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,700
邂逅故事只是...故事
Stories are just that... stories.

322
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,580
我跟你说个秘密好吗?
Can I tell you a secret?

323
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,420
就是我们邂逅的那个舞蹈?
That dance that we met at?

324
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,580
当我和我的舞伴黄了的时候
When I went outside to break it off with my date,

325
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,640
她哭得很伤心 我很努力地安慰她
she was very upset, so I tried to comfort her.

326
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,180
然后 你懂的 一来二去 然后...
And then, you know, one thing led to another, and...

327
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,710
- 懂我意思么? - 还有别的意思吗
- You get what I'm saying? - Not if there's subtext.

328
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,990
我们在图书馆亲热 就在一堆书后面
We made out in the library, up against a bunch of books.

329
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,700
我都没有正式和她分手
I didn't even officially break up with her.

330
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,390
当我回去时 黛比在那
You know, so then when I got back, Debbie was there,

331
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,180
然后你懂的 "织梦者"
and, you know, "Dream Weaver,"

332
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,780
然后巴拉巴拉巴拉
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

333
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,630
所以你看 没人能真正知道
So you see, no one ever really knows

334
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,770
他们是怎么找到他们的灵魂伴侣的
how they found their soul mate.

335
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,130
或者他们的婚姻是建立在谎言之上的!
Or if their marriage was based on lies!

336
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,670
不 不是的 宝贝 我不是说...
No, no, honey, I wasn't saying...

337
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,360
"巴拉巴拉巴拉"?
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah"?

338
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,840
呸! 禽兽!
Ugh! Animal!

339
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,390
你没看到她站在那吗?
You didn't see her standing there?

340
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,340
就是我们聊天...你没看见她?
Like, while we were talk... never saw her?

341
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,450
高中舞会烂毙了
High school dances suck.

342
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,480
男孩蠢毙了
Guys suck.

343
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,210
为什么他们要那样做?
Why don't they stop doing that?

344
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,450
- 我哪知道 - 我们都不会那样做  
- I don't know. - We don't do that.

345
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,420
不那么过分 不会
Not as much, no.

346
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,870
给你纸 亲爱的
Here you go, sweetheart.

347
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,330
这是最伤心的部分
That's the worst part.

348
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,540
唉 上帝
Oh, God.

349
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,680
嗨 你为什么不和你的舞伴还有她的乌龟...
Hey. Why aren't you dancing with your date...

350
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,660
跳舞呢?
And her turtle?

351
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,840
我不怎么想去
I don't really feel like it.

352
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,060
你今晚怎么了?
So what's up with you tonight?

353
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,810
一直在饮料台旁边溜达
You've been lurking by the punch bowl,

354
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,470
现在还生闷气
and now you're sulking.

355
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,290
看起来像个郁郁寡欢的吸血鬼 哈?
Acting a little moody vampire-y, huh?

356
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,860
只是有点小伤心因为...
Just a little sad because...

357
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,990
我以为当我跟你说了之后今晚会是...
I thought tonight would be the night when...

358
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,450
我认为的那个夜晚
When I told you something.

359
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
雷吉 我一直在等着
Reggie, I've been waiting for this.

360
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,050
- 真的? - 是啊 
- You have? - Yeah.

361
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,490
好吧 我是说 我不知道外星人也有这样的倾向
Well, I mean, I didn't know that aliens could swing that way,

362
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,820
但同性恋也挺好的
but it's so cool to be gay.

363
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,090
外星人基友
Alien gay.

364
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,770
简直酷毕了 哥们
Totally rock 'n' roll, man.

365
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,140
不 琥珀 不是的 我不是同性恋
No. Amber, no. I am not the gay.

366
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,240
我以为今晚会是你意识到
I thought tonight would be the night that you realized

367
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,580
你和杰里米那个运动员不合适...
that you'd gotten it wrong with Jeremy the jock...

368
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,710
我才是你的灵魂伴侣
And that I'm your soul mate.

369
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,120
雷吉 我觉得你很棒
Reggie, I think you're great,

370
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,420
但直到今晚 你仍然只是我的朋友
but until tonight, you were my only friend.

371
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,540
你可能是我唯一真正的朋友
And you're probably still my only real friend.

372
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,944
我不知道我会不会把你当做其他的朋友
I just don't know if I really see you that other way.

373
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,110
对不起
I'm sorry.

374
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,950
这简直就是我最悲伤的感觉了
This is the worst thing I've ever felt!

375
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,130
我的胃在烧! 我的心在痛!
My stomach is burning! My heart's aching!

376
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,900
我觉得我要死了!
I think I'm gonna die!

377
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,950
噢! 儿子!
Oh! My son!

378
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,950
我要做什么? 他要死了吗？
What do I do? Is he dying?

379
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,020
我要怎么修补他? 这管用吗?
How do I fix it? Does this help?

380
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,770
她还以为我是基佬
She thought I was gay.

381
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,680
- 呃... - 好吧 打扰下 同志们
- Well... - Okay, I'm sorry, guys,

382
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,710
但你们做再多也不能摆脱这个感觉
but there's not much you can do to make this go away.

383
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,710
但好消息是你不会死
But the good news is you're not dying.

384
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,250
它就是那么痛那么悲
It just feels like it.

385
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,270
人类怎么能承受它?
How can humans stand this?

386
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,040
好吧 我们通常以我们的方式排解它
Well, often, we eat our way through it.

387
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,550
悲伤情歌可以缓解
Sad songs help.

388
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,530
或者跟鼓手亲热
And making out with drummers.

389
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,600
但其实你需要的只是时间
But mostly, you just need time.

390
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,100
这才是最重要的
That's the big one.

391
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,650
我要承受这种痛苦很久?
I gotta feel like this for a long time?

392
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,760
没错 可能还不止一次
Yeah. And probably more than once.

393
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,720
什么?!
What?!

394
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,100
你可能会以为你已经找到灵魂伴侣了
You may think that you totally found your soul mate.

395
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,980
但她可能不那么认为
And she doesn't feel the same way,

396
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,070
但那说明你们不是灵魂伴侣
but that just means you weren't soul mates.

397
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,750
- 啊! - 回到舞会
- Aah! - So get back out there,

398
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,870
继续寻找 因为你一定会找到的
and keep looking, 'cause you will find her.

399
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,350
没错 就像黛比・韦弗会找到她真正的灵魂伴侣一样
Yes. Like Debbie Weaver will find her real soul mate.

400
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,370
今晚她很痛苦是因为她知道了
Tonight she suffers because she has learned

401
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,080
她的真命天子并非马蒂 但她会重整旗鼓
it isn't Marty, but she will get back out there,

402
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,750
找到真正的那个他 尽管她年纪偏大了
and she will find him, despite her age.

403
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,480
不 不 不是这么回事
No. No. That's not it at all.

404
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,900
虽说马蒂那时候是个叛逆的
I mean, Marty may have been a completely revolting

405
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,330
十六岁不良少年
little monster of a 16-year-old,

406
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,720
但那晚他让我笑 而不是哭
but he made me laugh that night instead of cry.

407
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,380
很多很多次 多到数不清了
And there have been a million times since

408
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,650
他总能让我破涕为笑
where he has turned my tears into laughter,

409
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,090
通常是靠跳韦氏独舞
often via the Weaver running man...

410
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,180
他都不知道那舞很有趣
Which he doesn't even know is funny.

411
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,700
他自己都不知道诶
He doesn't even know it.

412
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,130
他就是我的真命天子
He is my soul mate.

413
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,820
这就是宇宙真理
And that is the universal truth.

414
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,220
亲 别给他发短信了 往前看呐
Honey, stop texting him and move on.

415
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,880
会找到你的那个他的 相信我
There are drummers in your future. Trust me.

416
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,820
她懂的可真多
Wow. She knows a lot.

417
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,710
可不是么
Yes, she does.

418
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,310
我打算回舞池去了
I think I'm gonna go back to the dance.

419
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,960
去吧 仔儿
Go, my son.

420
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,200
我以你为荣
I'm so proud of you.

421
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,370
而我呢 要回家了
And I am going home.

422
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,480
因为我的真命天子
Because my soul mate,

423
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,060
那个我注定要
and the man who I am destined

424
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,450
共度一生的男人
to spend all of eternity with,

425
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,750
就是个蠢货
is a jackass.

426
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,330
图书馆 是吧?
The library, huh?

427
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,300
重温旧梦?
Reliving old memories?

428
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,650
所有理想的生闷气地方都被
Well, all the good sulking spots were taken

429
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,050
痴男怨女 金童玉女 潘亢谀径占据了
by crying, kissing, or puking teenagers, so...

430
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,560
黛比...
Deb...

431
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,050
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

432
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,530
那是必须的
Well, you should be.

433
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,660
因为这次这梁子结定了
Because this... this is officially a thing.

434
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,220
你是个骗子
You were a weasel,

435
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,200
这辈子我都会这么念叨你
and you will hear about it for the rest of time.

436
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,040
那你笑什么?
So why are you smiling?

我得让你这么觉得

463

才能达到现在这么好的效果
for this to be so good, right?

464
