但其实像颗隐形导弹一样正中目标

昨天是一个长的像里吉斯的双头怪

51
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,730
但其实是个喷火的...?
that turned out to be a fire- breathing...?

52
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,200
- 要我说应该是 青蛙? - 海蜇?
- I wanna say, frog? - Jellyfish?

53
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,340
管它是什么 我们海扁了它一顿
Whatever it was, we kicked its gelatinous ass.

54
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,880
我从未想过我会这么说 但我就是个人类 波
You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm only human, Bo.

55
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,810
无意冒犯 遇上这事你也不怎么欢乐啊
And, no offense, but you ain't lookin' so chipper either.

56
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,780
无论莫瑞根派来什么异种 我都应付得了
Hey, whatever the Morrigan dishes out, I can handle it.

57
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,420
昨天那记铁拳打得你还头晕否?
You still got that doozie from yesterday's slug fest?

61
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,060
那个医生...我意思是...
The doc... I mean...

62
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,230
像不像是用仓鼠滚轮
you know, isn't it like trying to charge an iPad

63
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,100
- 试着给Ipad充电? - 好吧 暂停一下
- with a hamster wheel? - Okay, time out.

64

65
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,260
啥?
Moi?

66
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,430
得了 肯吉 
Oh, come on, Kenzi, with

67

你那些个挖苦加翻白眼
the little digs and the rolling of the eyes...

68
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,740
- 我又不傻 - 呃...
- I'm not stupid. - Well...

这可是机会 趁我还撑得住
Here's your chance, while I'm still high

70
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,670
不想吸元疗伤之时 发泄出来吧
off my wicked moves. Get it out of your system!

71
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,340
她爱指手画脚 占有欲强 控制欲强
She is bossy, territorial, and controlling.

72
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,080
她觉得你幼稚 不负责任 还粘人
She thinks you're immature, irresponsible and clingy.

73
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,280
你这么说!?
She does!?

74
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,920
你自己都那么说过自己
Oh, you've said those things about yourself.

75
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,280
是啊 但是自己说自己那叫可爱好吗
Yeah, but when I say it, it is adorable.

76
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,790
好吧 关键是我爱劳伦
Okay, the point is I love Lauren.

77
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,890
她对我很重要 你也是
She's a huge part of my life. As are you.

78
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,430
所以这场"闺蜜"对战"女友"的戏码
So in the Battle of BFF versus Main Squeeze,

79
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,700
我们该叫停了 明白吗?
I think it's time we called a truce. Got it?

80
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,370
现在 大家和波一条心 去喝酒吧 我请客
Now, all those on Team Bo... drinks are on me.

81
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,910
那才对...
That's right...

82
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,550
布鲁斯...你真让我失望
Oh, Bruce... you disappoint me.

83
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,710
- 我叫斯蒂夫 - 怎么回事呢?
- I'm Steve... - How did this happen?

84
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,410
不是我的错 她有个后援
It's not my fault, she had an army.

85
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,620
- 别侮辱我的智商!
- Don't insult my intelligence!

86
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,690
你撒谎功力比你哥哥埃里克都差
You're a worse liar than your brother, Eric.

87
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,860
- 他叫戴夫 - 我才不管!
- Dave. - I don't care!

88
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,660
要不是我刚去做了美甲
If I hadn't just had my nails done,

89
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,760
我早就亲手把你的心挖出来了
I'd rip your beating heart out myself.

90
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,330
您真是太善良了
You're too kind.

91
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,870
我觉得某人的气焰
I think someone's getting

92
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,740
真是越来越嚣张了
a little too big for her leather britches.

93
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,880
快了 我的乖乖...快了
Soon, my pet... soon.

94
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,990
如果我们的小淫妖觉得玩得起
If Li'l Bo Bleep thinks she can play in the big leagues...

95
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,760
那就让游戏开始吧
let the games begin.

96
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,200
当你不知道你是谁时 生活会很艰辛
Life is hard when you don't know who you are.

97
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,370
当你知道真相后 生活会更艰难
It's harder when you don't know what you are.

98
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,000
我的爱伴随死神的降临
My love carries a death sentence.

99
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,870
我迷失了多年 在藏匿中找寻
I was lost for years, searching while hiding.

100
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,810
那个不为人知的属于我的世界
Only to find that I belonged to a world hidden from humans.

101
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,880
但我已经厌倦了躲藏
I won't hide anymore.

102
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,420
我要过自己想要的生活
I will live the life I choose.

103
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,160
心电图 核磁共振 植物病毒检查
Ekg, mri, emv...

104
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,090
读到虐恋剧情的时候再叫我
Wake me up when you get to S&M.

105
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,760
看吧 事实上 伐克斯...
See, the truth of it, Vex, is that...

106
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,040
别 别忽悠我 医生 有话直说吧
No, don't sugar coat it, Doc. Just give it to me straight.

107
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,370
好吧 生理学上看 你的胳膊已经痊愈了
Okay... there is nothing physically wrong with your arm,

108
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,940
而且神经系统 肌肉骨系统也没什么问题...
or your nervous system, or your musculoskeletal system...

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,650
那 为什么 我不能
Then... why... can't I...

110
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,380
- 使用异种能力? - 你还真会定期爆点
- Get it up? - Oh, regular riot, you are.

111
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,700
既然没有生理学上的理论
Since there's no physiological

112
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,250
来解释你的催眠术为什么无效
reason for your mesmeric impotence...

113
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,690
啊哈!我让你挠痒痒了!
Aha! I made you do that!

114
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,460
- 没 其实 刚刚只是有点痒 - 该死的!
- No, actually, that was just an itch. - Damn you!

115
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,590
我意思是你的"情况"
What I'm trying to say is that your "Condition"

116
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,460
可能实际是心理问题
may be psychological in nature.

117
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,030
你意思是我废了?
What, you sayin' I'm whacked?

118
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,900
像个疯子似的? 傻子缺八两?
Like I'm a nutter? A few ounces short of a pound?

119
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,500
以你的年纪 这现象很常见
It's not at all uncommon in Fae your age.

120
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,240
你知道你在跟谁说话吗?
Do you have any idea who you're talking to?

121
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,370
让你感受一下伐克斯之怒!
You shall feel the wrath of Vex!

122
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,410
擦
Bah!

123
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,750
你怎么还没勒死自己?!
Why aren't you strangling yourself by now?!

124
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,360
没什么好尴尬的
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

125
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,650
其实我有本小册子...
I actually have the pamphlet...

126
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,150
哦 省省你那套可悲的医生对病人态度
Oh, save your pathetic bedside manner

127

留给你那不长久的新女友吧
for your new, presumably temporary, girlfriend!

128
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,960
- 什么? - 哦 得了...要满足
- Excuse me? - Oh, come on... it can't be easy

129
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,460
上发条的淫妖兔的欲望可不容易啊
keepin' up with the Energizer SuccuBunny.

130
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,860
虽然戴森可以
Though Dyson could.

131
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,030
好吧 我觉得我们完事了
Okay... you know what? I think we're done.

132
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,830
不给我换点药吗
Any chance of a prescription refill?

133
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,400
- 出去! - 真的吗?
- Out! - Really?

134
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,340
无情的医生
Bloody physicians.

135
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,710
想象一下 假设什么也没问题
I mean, imagine sayin' that there's nothing wrong with it.

136
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,710
你听过这么扯的
I mean, have you ever heard anything so...

137
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,880
喂! 酒保! 我在跟你说话!
Hello! Barkeep! I'm talking to you!

138
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,220
- 还在说? - 难以置信!

00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,420
我在这儿掏心挖肺 你却
Here I am, pouring out my heart to you and...

140
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,660
好吧 戴森 我可不是来娱乐的
Ok Dyson, I'm not here for my health.

141
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,930
你到底看不看这些文件?
You wanna look at these case files or not?

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,270
肯定看 再等等
Uh, absolutely. Just gimme a sec...

啊...问候你们呀
Ah... greetings.

144
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,100
- 闭嘴 伐克斯 - 什么?
- Don't even start, Vex. - I beg your pardon?

145
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,510
- 我不会再给你买酒了 - 嘿  我很受伤诶
- I'm not buying you another drink. - Hey, I'm deeply offended.

146
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,210
- 很好 现在滚吧 - 嘿 你管不着我
- Good, now go away. - Hey, you don't own me.

147

好吧 听着...
Okay, look...

148
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,580
你那悲惨遭遇我们已经听得耳朵起茧了
we've been listening to your same sad story for days.

149
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,080
黑暗异族不想要我 光明异族受不了我
The Dark doesn't want me. The Light can't stand me.

150
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,750

他没有朋友 是吧?
he doesn't have any, does he?

152
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,920
- 伐克斯弱爆了 - 这是在侮辱我!
- Sucks to be Vex. - This is an outrage!

九号球 横袋
Nine ball... side pocket.

154
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,440
那个妞怎么回事?
What is it with that chick?

155
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,840
她不待见你而已
She's just not feeling the love.

156
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,440
- 但为什么? -因为她觉得你是个杀人犯?
- But why? - Because she thinks you're a murderer?

157
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,040
但更重要的是 你最近在忙什么?
But more importantly, what have you been up to?

158
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,180
什么? 哦...
What? Oh...

159
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,850
- 又是莫瑞根? - 哦 小菜一碟 
- The Morrigan again? - Oh, piece of cake.

160
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,050

迦楼罗被打败之后 光明异族
After the Garuda meltdown, the Light

162
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,620
和黑暗异族决定握手言和
and the Dark have agreed to play nice.

163
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,290
不结盟表示无保护
Unaligned means unprotected.

164
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,920
但是你忘了...
Oh, but you are forgetting...

165
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,790
我有这个
I have this.

166
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,960

我还是觉得你应该跟阿什谈一下
I still think you should talk to The Ash.

168
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,300
你看起来得好好休息一整子
You look like you could use a break.

169
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,000
我猜肯吉也可以
And I'm guessing Kenzi could, too.

170
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,940
不好意思...
Pardonez moi...

171
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,040
- 他又怎么了? - 我不知道
- What's his problem? - I have no idea.

172
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,640
你自找的 你懂得
You brought this on yourself, you know.

173
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,610
你就是这么当阿什的? 严爱政策?
Is this how you roll now? Tough love?

174
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,580
是你把莫瑞根拷在床上 拍了她的不雅照
You handcuffed the Morrigan to her bed for a Kodak moment.

175
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,980
你确定这跟
You sure this has nothing

176
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,420
你的异种联合国实验没关系?
to do with your Fae United Nations experiment?

177
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,350
光明异种和黑暗异种搭档办案? 搞毛?
A Light cop partnered with a Dark cop? Really?

178
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,720
正是这种愤世嫉俗
It's cynicism like that has kept our sides

179
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,530
阻碍了真正和平的建立
from building a genuine peace.

180
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,060
还有 你戴森跟谁搞在一起管你什么事?
Also, why do you care who Dyson is paired with?

181
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,430
- 我没有 - 我可不觉得
- I don't. - Didn't think so.

182
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,830
知道怎么做可以帮你摆脱现状吗?
Know what might help your situation?

183
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,740
碰巧我准备好了对光明异族的宣言书
Just so happens I had a declaration to the Light all prepared...

184
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,870
我是不会因为恐惧而被迫选择阵营的
I'm not gonna be pressured into choosing a side out of fear.

185
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,770
好吧 不能怪我想试试
Well, can't blame an Ash for tryin'.

186
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,240
听着 别管我了 我自己能解决这堆麻烦
You know what? Forget it. I can handle the shitstorm,

187
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,650
只是肯吉自己在纠结而已
it's just that Kenzi is starting to feel the strain.

188
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,420
现在谁才在上演严爱戏码?
Now who's dishing out tough love?

189
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,280
波 等一下...
Bo, hang on...

190
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,650
听着 自从我们解决掉迦楼罗之后
Look, since we got all Garuda-fied,

191
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,320
我一直在整理保存的机密文档
I've been doing some serious inventory of the archives.

192
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,660
结果?
And... ?

193
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,730
似乎有人偷走了我的正义之杖
Seems someone has grabbed my Staff of Righteousness.

194
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,860
是一根木制的权杖
The Staff is a piece of wood...

195
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,100
珍贵的仪式遗物...能力强大
a treasured ceremonial relic ... and very powerful.

196
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,000
据调查这权杖最近现在
Currently believed to be in the possession

197
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,900
在莫蒂默・法斯宾德的手上 卑鄙的典当商
of one Mortimer Fassbinder. Pawnbroker and sleazebag.

198
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,670
所以 如果我把权杖带来给你...
So, if I bring you this Staff...

199
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,340
我也许会派一支特遣队到你家附近
I could probably post a security detail near your place.

200
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,040
帮你留意莫瑞根的宠物
Keep an eye out for The Morrigan's pets.

201
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,880
- 我去哪里找这个法斯宾德? - 别心急 看反面
- Where do I find this Fassbinder? - Hold up, Slick...

202
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,150
你必须了解一下这权杖的背景知识
There's something you should know about the Staff.

203
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,620
谢了 布鲁斯!
Cheers, Bruce!

204
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,330
可爱的女士 今天是你的幸运日
Lovely lady, it is your lucky day.

205
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,960
你迈入门槛那刻我就可以杀了
I could have you killed just for crossing my threshold.

206
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,330
啧啧 冤冤相报何时了
Tut tut, bygones and all that...

207
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,000
请让我深切表达我对黑暗异族和你的忠诚
A heartfelt expression of my loyalty to the Dark. And you.

208
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,670
被困的我依然勾人
I am beautiful in restraints.

209
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,080
删除...
Delete...

210
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,880
- 还有什么别的事吗? - 哦 你不该高兴才对吗
- Was there something else? - Well, I thought you'd be pleased.

211
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,550
如果你真心想讨好我
If you really wanted to please me you would have

212
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,490
你就该提着那小贱人的头来见我
brought me that bitch's head on a platter.

213
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,060
但是... 但是我...
But... but, I...

214
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:10,060
但是最近你好像异种能力尽失?
But maybe your recent bout of impotence has spread to your spine?

215
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,600
算你走运 我同情心泛滥
Lucky for you, my pity outweighs my disgust.

216
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,900
我不会杀掉你的 至少不是今天
I won't have you killed. At least not today.

217
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,210
哦... 你太大度了
Oh... you're too kind.

218
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,280
我们都有自己的苦衷
We all have our cross to bear.

219
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,410
喝了它快滚吧
Now drink up and go.

220
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,050
下次我见到你...
The next time we meet...

221
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,320
你和波不是她死就是你亡 你自己选择吧
...either Bo or you will be dead. The choice is yours.

222
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,350
- 嗨 - 哦 嗨
- Hey. - Oh, hey.

223
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,320
你在做什么?
Whatcha doin'?

224
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,830
哦 只是做些医生的实验
Oh, you know, just some Doctor-y stuff.

225
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,930
你知道 我确实对你的工作很感兴趣
You know, I am actually interested in your work.

226
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,660
你可以告诉我你在做什么的
You can talk to me about whatever it is you do.

227
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,400
真的? 你想听听我最近着手的论文
Really? You want to hear about my latest monograph

228
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,290
关于与人类血液相比异种血液的
regarding the rhizome repellent gradient of Fae blood compared

229
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,000
排斥梯度
with human blood,

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,110
尤其是当其悬浮在等渗溶液中
especially when suspended in an isotonic solution?

231
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,680
- 或者我们可以去看部电影 - 好吧
- Or we could go to a movie. - Okay.

232
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,510
- 那是什么? - 哦...
- What is that? - Oh...

233
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,620
- 正义之杖 - 什么玩意?
- The Staff of Righteousness. - The who of what?

234
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,350
别问了 哦 也别碰
Don't ask. Oh, and don't touch.

235
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,690
那么 我能摸什么?
Well... what can I touch?

236
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,260
啊哈 真有趣
Haha, very funny.

237
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,170
你怎么啦?
What's gotten into you?

238
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,740
怎么说 本来还真没啥目的
Well, you know, nothing just yet.

239
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,340
但是现在我想也许我们可以...
But I was kinda thinking maybe we could, um...

240
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,710
哦...
Oh...

241
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,750
哇 我以为我只是顺路经过
wow... I think I just came by

242
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,780
看看我的手机是不是落在这里
to see if I left my phone here.

243
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,920
嗯... 我不清楚 让我们看看...
Hmm... I don't know. Let's look...

244
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,620
它不在这里 天啊
Well, it's not in there. Gosh, you know,

245
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,160
也许你把它调到震动模式了
with any luck maybe you left it on "Vibrate".

246
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,630
我以为昨晚之后你会很疲倦
I thought you'd be too tired after last night.

247
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,260
疲倦? 我可是力争金牌啊
Tired? I am going for the gold in the Succu-games.

248
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,270
好吧... 我不知道你怎么了
Well... I don't know what's gotten into you,

249
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,970
但我不能阻碍
but far be it from me to

250
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,970
一个年轻运动员的夺金梦
stand in the way of a young athlete's dream.

251
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,110
- 呦 阿伐 - 随你怎么叫
- Yo, V-man. - Whatever.

252
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,880
听上去好像某人情绪低落啊
Sounds like somebody woke up on the wrong side

253
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,520
换了个人似的 怎么啦?
of the pull-out couch this morning. What's up?

254
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,220
- 是我的胳膊 - 又在讨同情了?
- It's my arm. - Again with the pity parade?

255
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,460
听着 你的翅膀折了 你不能飞了
Look, you got a busted wing, you can't fly.

256
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,030
你要像我们这些可悲的人类一样活着了
You gotta walk around like the rest of us poor miserable humans.

257
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,230
欢迎来到肯吉的世界! 老兄!
Welcome to Kenzi-ville! Man!

258
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,570
现在你知道每天被一群超级英雄
Now you know what it's like to be surrounded

259
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,500
环绕左右的感觉了吧 别抱怨了 可怜虫
by superheroes every day. Suck it up, Pathetico!

260
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,810
如果我是你 我会重新考虑在做社工
You know, if I were you, I'd re-consider a career in social work.

261
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,440
我们能不能
Can we just...

262
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,610
忽略你的异种身份哪怕十亿分之一秒
...forget about your Fae-self for like a nanosecond,

263
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,650
来聊一聊真正重要的事情?
and talk about something that's really important?

264
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,880
我表示怀疑
Doubtful.

265
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,050
- 睫毛膏 - 我洗耳恭听
- Mascara. - You have my attention.

266
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,720
老兄 你的睫毛美翻了!
Dude, your lashes are freakin' amazing!

267
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,490
是啊...刷睫毛的手法最重要 等等
Yeah... it's all in the brush technique. Wait...

268
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,820
我在达・芬奇那里找到了些小窍门
I picked up a few tips from Da Vinci.

269
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,190
- 像达芬奇密码一样? - 对 现在那里有个娘炮
- As in The Code? - Oh, yeah, now there was a queen for ya.

270
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,660
他就是戴维的跟屁虫
He was all over David's ass like curry on chips.

271
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,400
- 你能帮我整理下结块的睫毛吗? - 哦别这样
- Can you help me with my clumping? - Oh, please...

272
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,300
嗨 大家伙
Hey, y'all.

273
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,830
嗨... 怎么了?
Hey... Whazat?

274
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
长话短说 这就是个关于
The end of a long story, involving

275
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,610
谄媚的典当商和暧昧谈判的故事
a greasy pawnbroker and some hardcore negotiating.

276
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,810
呃 别吵 我们在做正事呢
Uh, do you mind? We're working over here.

277
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
有人看见我的手机了吗?
Anyone seen my phone?

278
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,580
你说手机? 怎么 你的手机?
You say phone? What, your phone?

279
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,280
听着 高抬贵臀让我看看坐垫下面有没有
Here, shift a cheek so I can look under the cushions...

280
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,850
没有
Nothing...

281
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,590
- 往旁边挪! - 你最后一次用它在哪里?
- Scootch! - Where'd you last have it?

282
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,220
这就是问题关键... 我发誓我把它放在...
That's the thing... I coulda sworn that I left it...

283
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,190
Ipad Iphone什么的电子产品 
Yeah, iPads, iPhones electricity...

284
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,390
说实话 只是一时狂热而已
it's all just a fad, really.

285
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,060
类似产品数不胜数 真理哦
The future's analog and all that. I'm tellin' ya.

286
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,400
我这么刷对吗?
Am I doing it right?

287
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,640
呃...
Uh...

288
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,040
嗯... 再往上一点...
Hmm... just a little bit up...

289
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,140
我 的 天
O.M.G.

290
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,410
你们在一起太有爱了
You guys are so cute together.

291
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,710
- 哈! - 呵...
- Ha! - Huh...

292
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,050
但愿我也能有个一起化妆的伙伴
I wish I had a makeup buddy.

293
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,250
我本以为她可以成为朋友 可她压根就不喜欢我
I thought she could be my friend, and she doesn't even like me.

294
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,250
- 谁? - 塔米辛!
- Who? - Tamsin!

295
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,960
她老刻薄了 对吧?
She is so mean girl, right?

296
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,790
我的意思是 就一个拥有实际人格的异种来说
I mean, buy an actual personality already.

297
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,130
你该不会是碰巧搜了我的行李箱
Did you happen to rifle through my duffel bag,

298
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,100
然后吞掉了那些老虎图案的黄色药片?
and scarf down a couple of yellow pills with tigers on 'em?

299
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,670
我要跟戴森谈谈
I'm gonna talk to Dyson.

300
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,710
顺便说一下 这可以是私人秘密
and BTW?, It is "trés" private.

301
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
私密?
Private?

302
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,880
劳伦要怒火中烧了!
Lauren's pelt is gonna be steamed!

303
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,650
你跟那个医生又是什么恩怨?
What's it with you and the Doc?

304
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,350
我指 除了她对病人的态度
I mean, besides her terrible bedside manner

305
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,020
和她脑瓜比你灵的事实
and the fact that she's a damn sight cleverer than you.

306
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,620
还很卑鄙 她在监视波
Not to mention sneaky. She spy-banged Bo.

307
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,830
可戴森伤了波这么多次
Dyson's drop-kicked Bo's heart ten times over,

308
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,360
而且他在的时候你还对他大吼大叫的
and you still howl when he comes 'round.

309
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,300
我...! 没有!
I...! No!

310
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
听着 你到底还要不要教我
Listen, are you gonna teach me

311
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,240
双面防水防污刷睫毛法了?
the double pump smudge-proof technique or not?

312
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,710
我为你感到骄傲 过来...
I'm so proud of you. Come here...

313
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,740
好了 你要像这样刷睫毛根部
Alright, you're gonna move it like this just at the ends.

314
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,610
你不要... 手抖...
You can't... like shake it...

315
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,350
我不喜欢你朋友
I do not like your friend.

316
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,880
她不是我朋友 她只是我的新搭档
She's not my friend. She is my new partner.

317
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,650
她怎么说的我?
What is she saying about me?

318
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,860
不管她怎么说 那都不是真的
Because whatever it is, it's not true.

319
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,890
- 你喝高了? - 什么? 你指酒?
- Have you been drinking? - What? Like, alcohol?

320
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,860
我倒希望如此
I wish.

321
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,170
- 你有假身份证吗? - 什么?
- Do you have fake ID? - What?

322
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,470
我们做吧
Let's do it.

323
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,570
我们去吧
Let's get faced!

324
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,110
好吧 你有点不对劲 我要去跟特里克谈谈
Okay, you are cut off. I'm gonna talk to Trick.

325
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,990
哇 你真美
Wow, you're so beautiful.

326
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,330
抱歉...
I'm sorry...

327
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,960
我得走了...
I gotta go...

328
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,710
- 我认为戴森喜欢我 - 什么?
- I think Dyson likes me. - Say what?

329
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,280
别告诉别人... 但我有吻他的冲动!
Don't tell anyone this... but I think I might kiss him!

330
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,000
瞳孔没有扩张...
There's no pupil dilation...

331
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,540
没有脑震荡
no concussion...

332
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,200
我困惑了
I'm stumped.

333
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,940
你的眼眸就像星星一样闪亮
You have little specks in your eyes that look like stars.

334
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,440
当我多虑了 但是你
Call me crazy, but based on

335
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,940
在酒吧的状态
your little display at the bar...

336
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,250
我是说 我知道你和戴森有过去
I mean, I do know that you and Dyson...

337
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,150
三号通道泄露! 三号通道泄露!
Spill on aisle 3! Spill on aisle 3!

338
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,210
嗷 嗷
Ow, ow...

00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,750
来嘛! 我们去看电影吧
Come on! Let's go to a movie.

340
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,220
哇 火辣的美妞 你吻过女孩不?
Wow, you're really hot. Have you ever kissed a girl?

341
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,260
我需要你乖乖坐好 还得检查你的心电图 好吗?
I need you to sit still to check your EKG, ok?

342
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,960
- 呲 - 波 别闹!
- Bzzz! - Bo, stop!

343
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,390
现在我们已经交换了脑电波
We have now swapped brains.

344
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,160
嗨 我是劳伦医生 我特无趣
Hi, I'm Dr. Lauren. I don't like to have any fun.

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,630
带两个皱眉图案的布朗尼蛋糕 明天打电话找我吧
Take two frownie brownies and call me in the morning.

346
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,100
你这样儿真吓到我了
You're really starting to scare me.

347
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,800
好了 波 听我说
Okay Bo... just listen to me...

348
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,000
波! 听我说
Bo! Listen to me...

349
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,210
你最近有接触过陌生的异种吗
have you come in contact with any strange Fae lately...?

350
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,610
- 这太无聊了 - 波 拜托!
- This is so lame! - Bo! Please!

351
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,040
好吧
Okay, well...

352
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,910
倒是遇到一个挥着魔棒的恶男
there was this one gross guy with a magic stick...

353
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,460
嗨 塔米儿 塔辛 砰砰辛警官 
Hey, Tammers. "T-sin". Officer "Slamsin"!

354
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,500
- 好吧 - 你这是在自娱自乐吗?
- Okay... - Are you playin' with yourself?

355
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,200
这是谁拿啤酒把你给灌倒了?
Did somebody spike your brewski?

356
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,100
兄弟 这一刻终于发生了
Dude... this one time That totally happened.

357
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,800
我要扮肯吉 一个模子刻出来的有木有
I got to be Kenzi. Nailed it.

358
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,740
好吧 这要是是你想在我们办案前就想让我出局
Right... if you're trying to throw me off my game

359
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,570
这招还真管用了
before we get down, it's working.

360
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,710
- 你觉得波对我有好感吗? - 我看着像管这种闲事的人么
- Do you think Bo likes me? - Do I look like I care?

361
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,220
我想约她出去
I think I'm gonna ask her on a date.

好吧 你自便吧
Okay, well... knock yourself out.

363

于此同时 你要不就一起玩
In the meantime... you're either in the game...

364
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:27,830
- 要不就别挡道 - 你真是个坏家伙
- or you are in my way... - You are so badass.

365
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,600
波和戴森排排坐树上
Bo and Dyson sitting in a tree...!

366
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,070
嘘!

372
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,720
把它放回去 能把车钥匙给我吗?
"Put it back." Can I have the car keys?

373
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,630
不行
No.

374
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,300
要是不给我车钥匙 我就用法语数数
If I don't get the car keys, I'm gonna count to a hundred.

375
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,670
数到一百为止
In French .

376
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,400
- 老天 - 看到没?
- Good grief... - See what I mean?

377
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:09,970
一
Un.

378
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,140
二!

379
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,470
三
Trois...

380
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,890
你觉得她这症状
You think this is being

381
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,410
像是因为阿什派她处理的任务而引起的吗?
caused by the job that The Ash sent her on?

382
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,350
四
Quatre...

383
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,410
你说呢
You tell me.

384
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,520
四
Quatre...

385
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,220
会不会是正义之杖引起这样的症状?
Can the Staff of Righteousness have symptoms like these?

386
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,250
- 四! - 是五!
- Quatre...! - Cinq!

387
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,120
- 我的神 是五! - 抱歉 法国警官
- For the love of Aphrodite, it's cinq! - Sorry, French Police.

388
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,330
五
Cinq.

389
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,590
六
Six...

390
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
乍看之下 没有记录
At first glance, there's nothing in the lore

391
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,600
显示这根权杖会引起这样的症状
that suggest the Staff is causing her symptoms.

392
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,930
但你也不能否认 这是很诡异的巧合
You have to admit, it's a pretty strange coincidence.

393
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,800
她找回权杖后 就成现在这个
She goes looking for the Staff and comes back like...

394
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,410
- 无忧无虑的傻妞 - 没错
- Pollyanna on mushrooms? - Exactly.

395
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,840

怎么没听到数七?
Where's "Seven"?

397
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,150
波 快下来!
Bo, get down!

398
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,390
嘿! 让我跳完! 别对我说教
Hey! Let me finish! Don't Kanye me.

399
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,090
- 你作弊! - 你能奈我何!
- You are a cheater! - Whatever!

400
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,690
你个骗子 诅咒你长痘痘
You're a cheater. And you're getting a zit.

401
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,170
波说的对 你个刻薄的女人!
Bo is right. You're mean!

402
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,070
不管是什么引起的 这症状会传染
Whatever this is... it's contagious.

403
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,310
别用棕色了 黑色才能刷出新意
...you gotta forget about brown... black is always the new black.

404
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,180
- 你别老跟着我们 - 是啊 你又不是我们的老妈
- You can't ground us. - Yeah. You're not our Mom.

405
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,450
没错 我们才不要听你的话
Yeah, we don't even have to listen to you.

406
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,220
所以 波把他俩都带疯了?
So... Bo shagged them both daft?

407
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,360
- 我们有麻烦了 - 更像是烂麻烦
- We have a situation. - More like a SHITuation.

408
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,820
你们像参观参观我的卧室吗?
You guys wanna see my room?

409
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,890
- 额 当然 - 看谁跑得快!
- Uh... yeah! - Shotgun!

410
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,160
- 不! 不! - 别 等等! 等等!
- No! No! - No, wait! Wait!

411
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,800
有东西引起了这个症状 更糟糕的是
Something's made them sick. And what's worse is the...

412
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,070
- 这是? - 一头猪?
- Is that...? - A pig...?

413
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,840
他在寻找些什么东西
He's looking for something...

414
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,850
或是什么人! 波
Or someone! Bo...

415
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,850
肯吉 刀在哪儿? 你的工具箱也行?
Kenzi, where is there a knife? Or your trunk?

416
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,050
- 额 在楼上呢! - 好吧 那你的剑呢?
- Uh, upstairs! - Well, what about your sword??

417
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,450
- 在 楼上! - 好吧 肯吉 赶紧想办法!
- Up... stairs! - Okay, well, Kenzi, think of something!

418
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,790
动脑筋神马的不是一般都是你的事么 医生!
That's usually your thing, Doc!

419
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,120
这只小肥猪就准备去市场挂售吧
This little piggy's about to go to market!

420
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,170
我们需要武器! 我们需要东西来防卫!
We need a weapon! We need something!

421
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,490
该死的
Bloody hell...

422
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,290
行了 猪猪 行了
That'll do, pig... that'll do.

423
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,490
你是怎么
How did you...

424
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,490
我
I...

425
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,500
原来你才是匹黑马
Aren't you the dark horse.

426
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,910
他死了
He's dead.

427
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,240
兄弟 我只是随手抓了根棍子
Dudes, all I did was grab this stupid shillelagh

428
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,410
然后突然之间我就成了达斯・维达
and all of a sudden I'm Darth Vader.

429
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,950
- 让我看看 - 说起这个
- Let me see that... - Yeah, about that...

430
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,820
这棍子貌似有点 粘在手上拿不下来了
the shaft is kinda... Fae-zy Glued to my hand.

431
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,460
是啊 我也有类似经历
Yeah... That happened to me once.

432
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,360
苦不堪言
Painful.

433
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,670
"赶紧拿个武器"她如是说
"Grab a weapon," She said.

434
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,910
这看起来像是高能键
It seems to be an energy bond.

435
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,940
- 那就解开键连呐 - 做不到啊
- So un-bond it. - I can't.

436
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,610
这木头和你手上的肉融为一体了
The wood is melded to your flesh.

437
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,550
世上最挫的手淫工具
Worst hand job ever.

438
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,780
哇 老兄! 拿刀作甚?
Whoa, Mack! The knife!?

439
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,450
不是啊 我电视上看到的 切木头和番茄
No, I saw it on TV. It cuts right through wood.

440
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,890
轻而易举
And tomatoes.

441
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,590
不是我的错 棍子惹的祸
Not my bad. Stick bad.

442
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,600
还有 这音乐难听死了!
Plus... your music sucks!

443
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,930
我买那碟是用来鄙视的
I bought that one ironically.

444
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,130
说实话 没看得上眼的
All of them, actually...

445
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,670
- 额 这到底是啥? - 哦 看看这货!
- Um, what the heck is this? - Oh! Look at that!

446
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,840
你声音怎么了?怎么突然冒苏格兰口音
What is with your voice? It's all Scottish-y.

447
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,540
哦 好吧 你喜欢不?
Oh! Well, do you like it?

448
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,240
挫透了
It's lame.

449
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,910
- 不喜欢 哟 同志们! 我们遭攻击了
- No. - Yo, peeps! We are under attack!

450
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,850
- 尖叫声在哪里 - 这下好了
- Big whoop. - Fascinating.

451
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,820
他们貌似连危机感都消失了
They seem to be immune to any sense of danger.

452
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,120
哦 真要命 嘿!
Oh for god sakes... Hey!

453
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,990
我们客厅还躺着只死猪呢
We have a dead man-pig in the living room,

454
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,090
我这还有根树枝离不了手
I have a tree stuck to my mitt,

455
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,590
我可不想报名加入幼托俱乐部
and I did not sign up for the babysitter's club!

456
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,000
哦 戴森碰到我的胸了!
Oh, Dyson touched my boob!

457
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,200
这是个意外! 那是我胳膊肘干的!
That was an accident! It was with my elbow!

458
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,400
拜托!这不算!
Doesn't even count! Come on!

459
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,570
不是吧!
Seriously?

460
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,740
同志们 同志们 同志们! 我们点披萨吃吧!
Guys, guys, guys! Let's order pizza!

461
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,040
没错
Yes.

462
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,870
他们三个处于某种原因都被感染了
For some reason, only the 3 of them are infected.

463
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,440
我们要小心点
Let's not take any chances.

464
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,710
不要和他们有肢体接触直到我找到真正病因
No physical contact until I know what we're dealing with.

465
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,540
- 明白了 - 双层奶酪! 好耶!
- Got it. - Double cheese! Yeah!

466
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,210
双层奶酪! 披萨!
Double cheese! PiZZA!

467
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,910
- 披萨! - 披萨!
- Pizza!!! - Pizza!

468
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,750
然后你们三个 乖乖呆着别乱跑
And you three, stay put.

469
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,080
快买披萨来!
Get the pizza!

470
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,820
这些武器你哪儿来的?
Where did you get these??

471
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,720
- 太帕! - 给我一把
- It's fantastic! - Give it to me...

472
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,760
弱爆了
Totally lame...

473
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,360
哇 这还有一把! 你!放马过来吧
Aww... There's another one! Come here, you!

474
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,060
我不明白的是
What I don't understand

475
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,130
要是异种才是感染对象
is that if this disease only targets Fae...

476
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,660
那为什么伐克斯没事呢?
Why isn't Vex infected?

477
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,030
怎么说 也许是我超级逼真的妆容
Well, perhaps my superior genetic makeup

478
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,940
免疫了外界的侵害
has rendered me immune to embarrassing afflictions.

479
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,510
- 那是啥? - 什么?
- What is that? - What?

480
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,880
你耳后有奇怪的脓包
You have a strange pustule behind your ear

481
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,980
我上次给你检查的时候还没有呢
that wasn't there when I examined you last.

482
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,980
脓包 恶
Pustule... Ew.

483
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,160
恶 恶心!
Ugh... Ugh! UGH!

484
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,860
恶心死人了
Ewww with a double side of hurl.

485
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,830
- 这是什么? - 像是什么留下的茧
- What is it?? - It's what's left of a cocoon.

486
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,530
看来你被用作孵卵器了
You've been used as an incubator.

487
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,560
- 被什么当做孵卵器? - 我的猜测
- By what? - My guess?

488
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,630
- 寄生虫 - 什么? 我不干净?
- A parasite. - What? I'm unclean?!

489
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,570
放轻松 已经不在你体内了
Relax... it isn't in you anymore.

490
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,470
但是你哪儿招来的这寄身虫呢?
But where could you have picked this up?

491
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,870
你最近有很陌生异种待一起么?
Have you been with any strange Fae lately?

492
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,340
呃 他妈的贱人!
Ugh... damn bitch!

493
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,950
- 那是怎么了? - 那是怎么了?
- What's that? - What's that?

494
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,650
哦 没事 额
Oh, nothing, uh...

495
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,820
这事搞得我好受伤 额
I was just saying how devastated I was about all this, uh...

496
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,950
听着 我这就去找特里克帮忙 好不?
Listen, I'm gonna get some help from Trick. Alright?

497
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,820
我会想办法补救的 好不?
I'm gonna make things right. Alright?

498
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,320
你他妈对我做了什么?
What the hell did you do to me!?

499
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,270
拿你当传播寄生虫的利器了
Used you to spread a parasite.

500
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,230
- 哪种变态寄生虫 - 吸元寄生的那种
- What kind of bloody parasite!? - The parasitic kind.

501
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,570
靠吸取被害者对他人好感的荷尔蒙为生
Zaps its victims with nymphoid hormones.

502
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,270
把他们变成自恋顽童无法控制异种能力
Turns them into self-obsessed brats too young for Fae powers.

503
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,340
所以 他们易受攻击?
So, they're completely vulnerable to attack?

504
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,380
没错
Precisely.

505
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,520
那那些猪呢? 你派来的?
But what about the "Other white meat"? Relatives of yours?

506
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,790
感染源会发出刺激性荷尔蒙
The infected emit a pungent pheromone that attracts

507
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,620
吸引那些肮脏的下等异种来杀戮
a nasty breed of UnderFae in for the kill.

508
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,760
是啊 幸好肯吉用魔法小木棍把那小猪扭扭
Yeah, well, luckily Kenzi pounded little Piggly Wiggly

509
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,830
揍成了下等异种熏肉
into UnderFae bacon with her magic shillelagh.

510
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,660
- 那个贱女淫妖呢? - 还活蹦乱跳的呢
- And the Succubitch? - Still alive and singing.

511
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,900
还有两个悲剧帝 戴森和他的新搭档
Along with the other Twi-hards. Dyson and his new partner.

512
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,910
哦!事情真是越来越有趣了
Oh! Now this is getting interesting.

513
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:17,240
我最爱的三个人 被困在了一个地方
Three of my favorite people, trapped in one place...

514
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,780
无法自卫
with no way to defend themselves.

515
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,680
人类小女孩还拿着阿什的魔棒
And she's got The Ash's play stick.

516
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,320
想证明你对黑暗异族的忠诚吗?
You want to prove your loyalty to the Dark?

517
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,540
把那脑残三人组结果了吧
Finish off the teen trio,

518
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,590
然后把正义之杖带回来给我
and bring me the Staff of Righteousness.

519
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,700
要是我做到了?
And if I do?

520
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,000
我可以保证帮你找几个 初级岗位
I'm sure I could find some... entry level position...

521
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,100
做梦! 我要名至实归 百万现金
No! I want all titles restored ... A million in cash

522
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,060
还有我要拿回我的俱乐部 
and my club. I want it back.

523
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,540
这才是我认识的伐克斯
There's the Vex I remember.

524
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,250
"赶紧拿个武器"她如是说
"Grab a weapon", she said...

525
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,320
我已经解释好多次了 肯吉 我不知道会这样!
For the hundredth time, Kenzi, I didn't know!

526
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,420
知会媒体同胞 居然有完美医生不知道的事情!
Alert the media, there is something Doctor Flawless doesn't know!

527
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,060
那是紧要关头 肯吉
This is hardly the time, Kenzi.

528
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,590
当然不是 因为要是紧要关头肯定早已一片狼藉
Course it isn't... 'Cause that would be "Messy"!

529
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,230
你不能来一次 一次也行 你能试着
Do you think just once! Maybe just once, you could try to be...

530
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,400
- 试着干嘛? - 有所帮助!
- What? What?? - Helpful!

531
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,330
- 你说什么? - 没错!
- Excuse me? - Sure!

532
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,100
因为大家都尽其所能
Because everybody else does!

533
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,920
你却混混度日 没工作 没计划 成天饮酒作乐
You just bounce through life, no job, no plan, from one beer

534
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,670
每个人都把你捧手心里 难道不是?
to the next and still, everybody dotes on you, don't they?

535
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,310
他们宠谁碍着你什么事了?
What do you care where they dote?

536
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,810
- 当我没说 - 是啊 你这算什么
- Just forget about it... - Yeah... what is that?!

537
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,740
你为什么老用你那正常成长的经历
Why are you always rolling your eyes at me,

538
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:30,550
和医学学位翻白眼给我看
with your normal upbringing and your medical degree.

539
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,780
我过的是怎样的生活你毫不知情 肯吉
You don't know anything about my life, Kenzi!

540
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,980
我知道你看不起我
I know you think you're too good for me...

541
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,820
不 我真没有 是你觉得我配不上波
No, I don't actually! You think that I'm not good enough for Bo!

542
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,500
- 她是我闺蜜 - 可我也爱她
- She's my best friend. - And I love her.

543
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,430
我知道 我知道
I know! I know.

544
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,510
你确定我们没被感染?
Are you sure we're not infected?

545
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,970
姆
Mmmm...

546
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,010
没 我们只是
No. We're just...

547
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,110
犯傻
...stupid.

548
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,950
好吧 我还是喜欢"情绪化"一词
Well, I prefer... ..."emotional".

549
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:17,960
不弃前嫌?
Moving on?

550
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,360
- 一起宰猪? - 好
- Killer Pig? - Yeah...

551
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,630
好的
Yep, okay...

552
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,500
我不敢相信我居然以为你不待见我
I can't believe I ever thought you didn't like me.

553
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,870
我不认为我能喜欢你
I don't think I was supposed to like you.

554
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,410
为什么?你这是什么意思?
Why? What do you mean?

555
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,210
我是瓦尔基里
I'm a Valkyrie.

556
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,050
- 好像是 - 哇
- I think. - Wow...

557
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,250
真的?
Really?

558
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,920
- 瓦尔基里是什么? - 我不知道
- What's a Valkyrie? - I don't know.

559
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,780
但是 有时当我有所爱
But... sometimes when I like people,

560
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,060
我却不得不放手
I have to make them go away.

561
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,900
- 你这是什么意思? - 你会保守秘密吗?
- What are you talking about? - Can you keep a secret?

562
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,770
至死不渝
Till I die.

563
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:10,340
姆
Um...

564
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,440
- 不 我不能说的 - 别 等等 等等!
- No, I'm not supposed to. - No, wait! Wait!

565
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,580
我有个主意 这样
I have an idea! Okay...

566
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:26,520
我们把自己最黑暗 隐藏最深的秘密以诗的形式
Let's write down our deepest, darkest secrets...

567
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,890
写下来
...in poetry.

568
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,560
酷!
Cool!

569
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,390
但要真的像首诗啊 要押韵的那种
But like real poetry. The kind that rhymes.

570
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,700
你真是个很好的人
You're really awesome.

571
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,240
不 你才是
No. You're really awesome.

572
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,910
额
Um...

573
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,510
哦 哦!
Oh, oh!

574
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,580
看到那猪脸了吗?
See its snout?

575
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,720
它的遗传结构与猪相似
It's similar in genetic makeup to the pig.

576
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,520
他以气味捕食猎物 他知道我们之中
It was scenting out its prey, it knew which of us

577
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,720
谁感染了寄生虫
was infected with the parasite.

578
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,250
块菌猪威武霸气
Hurray for the Truffle Pig.

579
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,650
这种生物群居为生
These creatures travel in packs.

580
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,060
当他们的兄弟没有回去
When their buddy doesn't return...

581
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,390
他们就群攻?
They'll all go hog wild?

582
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,290
我们的魔法棒也不够救咱们的
Not even my wonder whacker may be enough to save us.

583
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,030
所以我们需要波和其他人恢复正常
That's why we need Bo and the others back to normal.

584
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,600
根据我从伐克斯耳后的茧中提取的分泌物
Based on the secretions that I pulled from the cocoon

585
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,070
我可以凑出个寄生虫的抗生素
from Vex, I think I can cobble together an anti-toxin

586
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,370
- 但我需要时间 - 也许还要个实验室
- for the parasite. But I need time. - And a lab, maybe?

587
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,580
好吧 这倒不必 我工具箱里有些基本配备
Well, not necessarily. I've got a few basic supplies in my kit.

588
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,910
但我需要你帮我去凑齐几味配料
But I need you to gather up some ingredients.

589
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,450
呃 发酵粉 醋 姜黄
Uh, baking powder, vinegar, turmeric...

590
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,550
好 好 好的
Yeah, yeah, okay...

591
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,920
好了 说吧
Alright, go...

592
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,050
还有 大蒜 发胶和润滑油
Also, garlic, hairspray, and lubricating oil.

593
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,490
加工的还是散装的?
Flavoured or bulk?

594
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:40,590
至于我 我要去楼上采样
As for me... I'm going upstairs to take a swab.

595
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,130
哇 哇 哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

596
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,230
医生 你单枪匹马的去了? 不带个后援?
Doc, you goin' in solo? Without backup?

597
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,430
- 我能搞定 - 你的固执和专横真是半斤八两
- I think I can do this. - You're as stubborn as you are bossy.

祝你成功
Godspeed.

599
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:57,970
好吧!
Okay!

600
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:07,650
- 发生什么事了? - 不想说这个
- What happened? - I don't want to talk about it.

601
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:11,150

00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,230
我还在外面装了一个预警系统 小鬼当家范儿
I set up an early warning system outside, Home Alone style.

你肯定毕业于哪个疯人医学院

耶鲁教会了我化学和生理学
Yale taught me chemistry and physiology.

610
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:40,010
但是这东西只是经验和运气
But this kind of stuff is just experience and luck

611
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,220
是我实地经验琢磨出来的
and whatever I figured out in the field.

612
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,890

615
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,730

你在听戴森尿尿
You're listening to Dyson take a whiz.

I am not.

00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,210
你读了我的诗没? 写的很烂 是吧?
Did you read my poem? It was stupid, right?

619
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,750
没 我喜欢 很喜欢
No, I liked it. A lot.

620

在某种程度上 你写的很美
Yours was really beautiful... in a way.

621
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,560
但是这故事真的 真的很悲伤
But it was... really, really sad.

622
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,760
我真希望能做些什么可以帮到你
I wish there was something I could do to help you.

623
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,660
你帮不了我的
You can't help me.

624
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,430
没人帮得了我
Nobody can.

625
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
这是我们的秘密?
Our secret?

626
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,810
我发誓
Cross my heart.

627

请把我变成异妖吧
Make mine a Fae-cuccino, please...

628
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,430
我刚刚过滤了杂质 老天 我希望
I'm just straining any impurities. God, I hope...

629
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,160
警报响起!

The 3 little piggies are back! And this time, it's personal.

00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,560
我要回家了
I'm going home.

636
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,000
- 你这虚伪的混蛋 - 噢

我那么相信你!

那么 把淘气小淫妖交出来 让我们早点打道回府!
Yeah, well, just give us the rugrats so we can all go home!

640
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,070
休想!
Not on your miserable life!

641
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,910

Duran Duran?

645
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,810

00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
玩过的转瓶游戏大不一样啊
any Spin The Bottle game I ever played.

00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,340
我觉得你要说的应该是傻瓜一词
I believe "Wanker" Is the word that you're looking for.

672
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,550
你个卑鄙的叛徒
A dirty traitor!

673
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,620
想想我还和你共享了
And to think I shared my

00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,820
我的限量版紫精灵闪粉

675
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,920
哇 你以为共享化妆品就让我们成朋友了?
Aw, you think sharing makeup makes us friends?

676
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:37,320
别这样 你能自己做主
Don't do this... I thought you were your own man.

677
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,390
我的确是自己的主宰啊 而且我刚好有把斧头
I am my own man! And I happen to have an axe.

678
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,160
但是你不是为了自己才干这事的
But you're not doing this for you.

679
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,960
你这么做是为了那个贱女人
You're doing it for that stupid bitch!

680
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,460
做什么也比这有格调
Anything is better than this!

681
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,300
我是说 看看我! 我睡沙发!

她不会满心欢喜的欢迎你

听着 亲爱的 明显你也看过那本

人质谈判第一章第一篇 所以我们能跳页么

687
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,510
说说我活成这样哪里好了
to the bit where you tell me I'm better than this?

688
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,680
- 这样的你好 - 要是不好呢

我感觉我终于看到了真正的伐克斯

他是真正的艺术家! 他温文尔雅!
He's a true artist. He's a gentle soul!

693
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,390
而且他不会被轻易愚弄 莫瑞根也不行
And he will not be trifled with. Not even by her!

694
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,000
他已经受够了
He's done with that!

695
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,840
伐克斯 拜托!
Vex... please!

696
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,440

我觉得被美人揍
I don't think I'd mind getting my ass kicked

705
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,310
- 我一定也不介意 - 可是很疼的

头晕晕的 就像
But fuzzy, like...

718
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,180
的确发生了什么 但是不记得了?
...like there's something there, but why can't I remember?

719
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,850
因为你本该忘记
Because you're not supposed to.

720
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,710
我们还是别纠结的好
We're probably better off this way.

721
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,180
是啊 注意不错 塔米
Yeah, good call, Tammy.

722

所以 谢谢你毁了我的周末 还有再见
So, thank you for destroying my weekend, and goodbye.

You're kidding me.

00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,280
你继承了一个重大的责任
This is a huge responsibility you've taken on.

我就是信手拈来了个棍子!

闭上眼然后跟我念 不准偷瞄
Close your eyes and say the words... No peeking.

747

00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,560
我 拒绝
I... decline.

749

就这么简单?
It was that easy?

750
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,130
你怎么不早说?
Why didn't you just say so?

751
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,100
干嘛? 血圣就不能找乐子么?
What? A Blood King can't have a little fun?

752

你的室内装潢师水平真不咋地
I don't think much of your interior decorator...

It's a work in progress.

754

和你一样
Much like yourself.

755

别转移话题 这事还没完
Don't change the subject. You're not off the hook yet.

756

你有印新商务名片么
Did you get the new business cards,

758
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,440
也许买了车办了自选车牌
yet? Maybe a little vanity plate?

759
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,310
- 当爹的好光荣 - 你违反了异种法律

哦 就逗逗淫妖这点小事么?

我仍记得当年

764
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,360
小抢小闹
A little raping, a little pillaging,

765
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,790
古怪的"附带损坏"
the odd "Collateral damage"...

766
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,720
然后再给自己办个派对
and then you'd have yourself a party.

767

现在干嘛都是规则 规则

你的行为会破坏新的和平计划

怕你忘记 提醒你一下 这计划
A plan, in case you've forgotten,

770

是由异种长老们决议通过的

我能说什么?
What can I say?

我就是想为生活添点情趣

我做了三十年的警察了
I was a cop for thirty years.

775
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,980
学会一件事 屁话臭不可闻
One thing I learned... bullshit stinks.

776

女士 你臭气熏天了
And lady, you reek.

777

I will personally rip off

让你好看
your head and shove it up your lily white ass.

这次紧张局面缓和相当重要
This détente is important to be screwed up

781
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,930
不能被琐碎的小争执给破坏了
by some petty feud.

782
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,400
听清楚了没?
Am I clear?

783
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,400
明白了
Crystal.

784
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,740

But it shouldn't be, Kenz.

790
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,650
我不能住这儿了 在我做了这样的事之后
I can't stay here. Not after what I've done.

791
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,890
老兄 你救了我的命
Dude, you saved my life...

792
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,530
那只是那猪刚好移到了左边

if you'd looked at my history you'd know I was a betting man.

我要花点时间自舔伤口 你知道吗?
I'm going to take some time to reflect, you know?

Reset the system. I guess the Doctor was right!

799
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,510
见鬼的人类
Bloody humans...

800
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,660
- 你这是要去西藏? - 印度 路经维加斯

不会是你黑檀木手柄猪鬃胭脂刷吧?
Not your ebony handled bison bristle blush brush?

806
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,490
呃

807
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,350

You break that brush and I'll kill ya.
