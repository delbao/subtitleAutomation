The empire state building on Valentine's day,

×ÖÄ»
the most romantic building in the world

3
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:06,401
×ÖÄ»
on the most romantic day of the year.

4
00:00:06,452 --> 00:00:09,321
×ÖÄ»
So many memorable romances have played out here.

5
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:11,072
×ÖÄ»
Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant

6
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:12,757

×ÖÄ»
"Give me a smooch, right on the mug, see?"

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,095
×ÖÄ»
I do a pretty spot-on Cary Grant.

9
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:20,365
×ÖÄ»
And of course, the second-best romantic comedy

10
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:22,267
×ÖÄ»
that Meg Ryan and tom Hanks ever made:

11
00:00:22,268 --> 00:00:23,935
×ÖÄ»
Sleepless in Seattle.

12
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:26,238
×ÖÄ»
Every couple weeks, I buy a ticket

13
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,106
×ÖÄ»
and hang out in the lobby of the empire state building

14
00:00:28,107 --> 00:00:30,041
×ÖÄ»
to see if I will meet my one true love.

15
00:00:30,042 --> 00:00:32,911
×ÖÄ»
Captain, she's back.

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,463
×ÖÄ»
So you come here regularly

17
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:37,448
×ÖÄ»
to monitor the base of the building.

18
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:38,917
×ÖÄ»
I'm here to meet that special someone,

19
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:41,169
×ÖÄ»
and when I do, we're gonna go to the top,

20
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,154
×ÖÄ»
and then, boom! Fireworks.

21
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:44,455
×ÖÄ»
And who is that person?

22
00:00:44,473 --> 00:00:45,724
×ÖÄ»
I haven't met him yet,

23
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:47,058
×ÖÄ»
but I can tell when I find him,

24
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,178
×ÖÄ»
we're going to spend eternity together.

25
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,346
×ÖÄ»
Could you describe him?

26
00:00:51,397 --> 00:00:53,148
×ÖÄ»
All right, well, he's in his mid-30s.

27
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:56,818
×ÖÄ»
He is tall, dark, intense, mysterious...

28
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:58,403
×ÖÄ»
You understand why what you're telling us

29
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:00,155
×ÖÄ»
would cause us serious concern.

30
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:01,489
×ÖÄ»
Yeah. I can't help it,

31
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:03,191
×ÖÄ»
you know, even though it's dangerous,

32
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:04,693
×ÖÄ»
because I am a true believer.

33
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:07,529
×ÖÄ»
Hey, we're gonna need Miller from homeland security.

34
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,997
×ÖÄ»
Homeland security?

35
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:10,198
×ÖÄ»
That's a cool show.

36
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:11,867
×ÖÄ»
Why do you have a bag with a passport

37
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:13,034
×ÖÄ»
and three cell phones?

38
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:15,120
×ÖÄ»
Okay, well, this is for the Internet,

39
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:16,838
×ÖÄ»
this is for texting,

40
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:19,507
×ÖÄ»
and this flip phone is because I do not know

41
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:20,825
×ÖÄ»
how to transfer my old contacts.

42
00:01:20,843 --> 00:01:23,494
×ÖÄ»
You know, we've been spending so much time

43
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:24,829
×ÖÄ»
talking about me

44
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,132
×ÖÄ»
that I haven't asked you anything.

45
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:29,684
×ÖÄ»
- What are you into? - Protecting this building.

46
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:32,220
×ÖÄ»
Ooh, I love that. It's so old-fashioned.

47
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:33,889
×ÖÄ»
You have great facial hair.

48
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,023
×ÖÄ»
I love a guy with a beard.

49
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:36,191
×ÖÄ»
Can I touch it?

50
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:37,675
×ÖÄ»
Hands on the table, please.

51
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:39,277
×ÖÄ»
Hey, it's cool if you're into me.

52
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:41,363
×ÖÄ»
Kevin Garnett once bought me a coke at a P.F. Chang's.

53
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:42,781
×ÖÄ»
You're not helping yourself.

54
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:44,532
×ÖÄ»
I'm just saying I don't see a wedding ring.

55
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:48,820
×ÖÄ»
Is there a Mrs. Confederated security solutions?

56
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:51,356
×ÖÄ»
Oh, my God.

57
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:53,191

with Dr. Castellano.

62
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:14,729

He might be dead. What?

There's definitely a smell. Okay.

Holy crap! What the hell?

Yep?

Danny, get up. Are you kidding me?

Okay, I'm up. Put some pants on.

69
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:29,344
×ÖÄ»
I can see the outline of your penis.

70
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:30,545
×ÖÄ»
I know that eye patch dumped you,

71
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:33,431
×ÖÄ»
but you can't just spend the night in your office, drunk,

72
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:35,550
×ÖÄ»
playing weird Bruce Springsteen songs on your tiny piano.

73
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:36,768

Stop that.

74
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:38,720

What's... oh, God. I stood up too quick.

75
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:40,721

This is awful. What's the matter with you?

76
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:42,807

Your voice is too loud.

This isn't me. It's you.

Okay, that is not me.

When I lay on the floor, it's adorable,

80
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:48,396
×ÖÄ»
and it is tragic.

81
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:49,648
×ÖÄ»
When you lay on the floor,

82
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:51,483

you look like an upside-down ladybug.

83
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:53,368

My God, am I the only person not crawling about

84

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,354

You guys, I dropped a Mike and Ike on the floor.

86

I'm gonna get myself together.

I'm gonna pull it together.

91

I'm gonna meet another girl. It's gonna be good.

92
00:03:05,131 --> 00:03:06,531

I have found that when I am heartbroken,

93

it is actually best to throw myself into work.

94
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,385

Which is why, on Thursday, I am going to do you

I-I hadn't remembered. Okay.

102

Wait, how come you, of all people,

103
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,630
×ÖÄ»
don't have plans on Valentine's day?

104
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:24,315
×ÖÄ»
Well, as a man who's looking to avoid

105
00:03:24,316 --> 00:03:25,600
×ÖÄ»
a committed relationship,

106
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:27,318
×ÖÄ»
Valentine's day can be something of a minefield.

107
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:29,437

"Oh, a dozen roses. You must really like me."

108

"Hey, do you want to share a dessert?"

109
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,006

"Oh, that means you must want

110
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:33,274
×ÖÄ»
to meet my parents, who live in Minneapolis."

111
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:34,943

It's an emotional Bosnia.

112
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:36,444

Think I'll sit it out, thanks. Well, great.

113

Then I can have Valentine's day with Jamie.

As in Jamie and Lucy?

115

Now, there's a great couple.

Nope, not as in Jamie and Lucy.

117

118
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:46,504

But aren't you worried about the incredible chemistry

119
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:47,539
×ÖÄ»
they seem to have?

120
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:48,823
×ÖÄ»
They don't have good chemistry.

121
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:50,104
×ÖÄ»
I have good chemistry with Jamie.

122
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:53,678

I'm really lonely.

123
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:55,930

Moma was such a fun idea, Mindy.

124
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:58,800
×ÖÄ»
I love modern art museums. Yeah.

125
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:00,185
×ÖÄ»
I feel like they're less intimidating

126
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:02,103
×ÖÄ»
'cause I think I could do the art.

127
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:03,638
×ÖÄ»
Oh, you know what? Your sticker is coming off.

128
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,773
×ÖÄ»
Oh, actually, leave it.

129
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:05,890

I like people to know that I had

130

×ÖÄ»
a more cultural day than they did.

131
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:08,860

Oh, it's like the artsy version of "I voted."

132
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:10,928

Oh, yes, I have a ski lift ticket

When you teach Latin for a living,

it helps to look like a huge jock sometimes.

136

Hey, you guys.

It turns out the defendant's gang

×ÖÄ»
- What? - Oh, my God.

142
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:24,776

They always threaten me. Nothing ever pans out.

143

×ÖÄ»
Can you believe what this girl deals with? No.

144
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:29,047

Every day, she looks murderers in the eye and puts them

in prison for the rest of their lives.

146

I delivered a baby last night.

149
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:36,254

He did not want to be born.

150

He was really mad at me.

151
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:39,057

I'm glad he didn't have my home address.

152

That's really funny.

153
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:41,760

Hey, seriously, though, you know,

00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:43,478
×ÖÄ»
if you ever fear for your safety, you still have a key.

155

If you ever want to stay at my place,

156
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:46,064
×ÖÄ»
you know you can, right?

157
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:48,099
×ÖÄ»
Well, I would rather take on the Sinaloa cartel

158
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:50,185
×ÖÄ»
than deal with the water pressure in this guy's shower.

159

It's not that bad.

00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:53,104
×ÖÄ»
It's not that bad.

161
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:54,439
×ÖÄ»
You're so great.

162
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:56,274
×ÖÄ»
You should have a boyfriend.

163
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:58,193
×ÖÄ»
I would love to meet a cool guy, except all the guys I meet

164
00:04:58,194 --> 00:05:01,162
×ÖÄ»
are either 19-year-old murderers or 80-year-old judges.

165
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:02,747
×ÖÄ»
You know what, I think I'm gonna find you someone.

166
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:04,199
×ÖÄ»
No, I really wouldn't try. Yeah, great.

167
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,835
×ÖÄ»
This girl is the pickiest dater I have ever met in my life.

168
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:08,536
×ÖÄ»
No, no, I'm actually a very good matchmaker.

169
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:10,038
×ÖÄ»
Well, I wish you luck,

170
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,257
×ÖÄ»
but no one's ever good enough for this girl.

171
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,324
×ÖÄ»
So I wouldn't even try.

172
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:16,010
×ÖÄ»
So Mindy at the museum...

173
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:19,180
×ÖÄ»
Ah, Danny.

174
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:21,099
×ÖÄ»
Tear up that suicide note. I have great news.

175
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:22,967
×ÖÄ»
Okay, that wasn't a suicide note.

176
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:24,602
×ÖÄ»
I was contesting a jaywalking ticket.

177
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:25,937
×ÖÄ»
Oh. I am sorry about that.

178
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:27,522
×ÖÄ»
Danny, I am going to set you up on a date.

179
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:29,891
×ÖÄ»
This morning you said I should throw myself back into work.

180
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:31,142
×ÖÄ»
That was, like, six hours ago, okay?

181
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:32,343
×ÖÄ»
That's an entire lifetime for some bugs.

182
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:33,444
×ÖÄ»
You're gonna love this girl.

183
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,396
×ÖÄ»
She is pretty. She is smart.

184
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:37,448
×ÖÄ»
She owns a motor scooter. Ah.

185
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:39,951
×ÖÄ»
It's Lucy. Lucy of Jamie and Lucy?

186
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,619
×ÖÄ»
They broke up? I am dating Jamie

187
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,787
×ÖÄ»
of Jamie and Mindy.

188
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:43,788
×ÖÄ»
We kissed mouths, Danny.

189
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:44,856
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I don't know.

190
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:46,124
×ÖÄ»
I just... I don't know if I'm ready.

191
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:48,042
×ÖÄ»
Well, you would also be doing me a huge favor.

192
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,627
×ÖÄ»
If you spend time with Lucy,

193
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:51,296
×ÖÄ»
then Jamie won't spend as much time with her.

194
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:52,463
×ÖÄ»
Also, this is a big deal.

195
00:05:52,464 --> 00:05:53,548
×ÖÄ»
I am setting you up with someone.

196
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:54,782
×ÖÄ»
You never set me up with anybody.

197
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,267
×ÖÄ»
That's not true. I hooked you up with Reynaldo.

198
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,119
×ÖÄ»
Your garbage man? Yeah.

199
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:00,121
×ÖÄ»
He was smokin' hot, but he was a little pretentious.

200
00:06:00,122 --> 00:06:02,440
×ÖÄ»
A little bit too well read, if I may say that.

201
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,441
×ÖÄ»
Danny, please do this for me.

202
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,576
×ÖÄ»
Can I think about it? Danny!

203
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:05,660
×ÖÄ»
You are so selfish!

204
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:06,944
×ÖÄ»
I don't care if you're depressed!

205
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:07,945
×ÖÄ»
Just help me out for once! Okay, stop...

206
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:09,080
×ÖÄ»
All right. I am gonna die alone

207
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:10,465
×ÖÄ»
unless you do this for me. Stop hitting me.

208
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:12,834
×ÖÄ»
I'll go on one date with her, okay?

209
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:14,135
×ÖÄ»
Are you serious? One.

210
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:15,620
×ÖÄ»
Oh, my God, Danny, thank you. Thank you.

211
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,954
×ÖÄ»
Okay. When everyone's mean about you,

212
00:06:16,955 --> 00:06:18,473
×ÖÄ»
I defend you most of the time.

213
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:19,807
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I'm good on the hug, though.

214
00:06:19,808 --> 00:06:21,142
×ÖÄ»
Thanks. To show my gratitude

215
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:22,594
×ÖÄ»
for this kindness,

216
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:25,963
×ÖÄ»
we can choose any city of real housewives to watch.

217
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:28,013
×ÖÄ»
Miami.

218
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:29,033
×ÖÄ»
Yes.

219
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,348
×ÖÄ»
Deborah, do you like working in the morgue?

220
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:37,717
×ÖÄ»
Well, I don't get a lot of patient complaints.

221
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:40,553
×ÖÄ»
It's funny that you work in the morgue

222
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:44,340
×ÖÄ»
because my name is morg-an.

223
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:48,311
×ÖÄ»
Please wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

224
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:49,312
×ÖÄ»
Nope.

225
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:51,314
×ÖÄ»
Nothing. Sorry.

226
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:53,199
×ÖÄ»
Uh, Dr. Reed.

227
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,734
×ÖÄ»
Did you see me hit on that girl?

228
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:55,868
×ÖÄ»
Unfortunately, I did, yes.

229
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,853
×ÖÄ»
I've had my eye on her for a while.

230
00:06:57,854 --> 00:06:58,988
×ÖÄ»
I'm gonna take her to the batting cages,

231
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:00,289
×ÖÄ»
if you know what I mean.

232
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,824
×ÖÄ»
Well, let me know how that doesn't work out.

233
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,076
×ÖÄ»
Okay, here's my plan. I am going

234
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:04,961
×ÖÄ»
to put these in the ladies' room

235
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:06,529
×ÖÄ»
in all the stalls.

236
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:08,414
×ÖÄ»
"Me with out go"... No, no, read it up...

237
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:09,665
×ÖÄ»
Oh. "Will you go out with me?"

238
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,634
×ÖÄ»
And then she'll be like, "What?

239
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:12,868
×ÖÄ»
Yes."

240
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:16,091
×ÖÄ»
Morgan, what if somebody uses the bathroom before her?

241
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:17,223
×ÖÄ»
Yep, not a good idea.

242
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:18,707
×ÖÄ»
Plan "B."

243
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:20,393
×ÖÄ»
Surprise her in her car tonight.

244
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:22,095
×ÖÄ»
That's a felony. Not on Valentine's day.

245
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:22,985
×ÖÄ»
Doesn't matter what the holiday is.

246
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:23,729
×ÖÄ»
Check the laws in this country.

247
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:25,064
×ÖÄ»
I'm not even sure about that.

248
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:28,384
×ÖÄ»
Morgan, wait.

249
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:30,853
×ÖÄ»
- Maybe I could help you. - Really?

250
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:32,772
×ÖÄ»
Oh, God, that would be so good.

251
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:36,409
×ÖÄ»
Coming, I'm coming.

252
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,410
×ÖÄ»
- Hey. - Hey.

253
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:38,945
×ÖÄ»
Why are you so early?

254
00:07:38,996 --> 00:07:40,580
×ÖÄ»
- Ten minutes? - Yeah.

255
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,747
×ÖÄ»
You're ten minutes early, Danny,

256
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:43,366
×ÖÄ»
which is worse than two hours late.

257
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,534
×ÖÄ»
Those last ten minutes,

258
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:47,253
×ÖÄ»
that's when I go from "Whoa" To "Damn."

259
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:48,504
×ÖÄ»
Wait a minute.

260
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:50,906
×ÖÄ»
Why did I have to come here first, anyways?

261
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,408
×ÖÄ»
Well, you are going on a date with my friend.

262
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:53,926
×ÖÄ»
Mm-hmm. And I wanted to make sure

263
00:07:53,927 --> 00:07:55,595
×ÖÄ»
that you didn't look weird.

264
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:56,912
×ÖÄ»
You had, like, a mustache or something.

265
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,415
×ÖÄ»
How would I grow a mustache since this morning?

266
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:00,749
×ÖÄ»
I don't know. I'm not Italian.

267
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,968
×ÖÄ»
Also, it's good when I'm getting pretty

268
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:03,136
×ÖÄ»
for there to be a guy here, so he can be like,

269
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:06,472
×ÖÄ»
"Hurry up! We're gonna be late!" What?

270
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:07,513
×ÖÄ»
Why are you looking at me?

271
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:09,108
×ÖÄ»
Are you sure you want to wear that?

272
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:11,611
×ÖÄ»
It being on me implies that I want to wear it.

273
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:14,597
×ÖÄ»
Okay. I like it.

274
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:17,316
×ÖÄ»
Wow.

275
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:19,768
×ÖÄ»
A whole room that's a closet?

276
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,037
×ÖÄ»
You could make this into a little gym,

277
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:22,271
×ÖÄ»
hang a heavy bag there.

278
00:08:22,272 --> 00:08:23,906
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, Danny, that's what I want.

279
00:08:23,907 --> 00:08:26,108
×ÖÄ»
I want a bag full of sand to punch

280
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:28,578
×ÖÄ»
instead of all my clothes.

281
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:30,246
×ÖÄ»
Okay, what about this one? You like that?

282
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,465
×ÖÄ»
Let me guess: You want me to wear a little black dress,

283
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:34,300
×ÖÄ»
push-up bra, high heels.

284
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:36,135
×ÖÄ»
Boring, sexy, anonymous girl.

285
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,336
×ÖÄ»
Sexy's not boring.

286
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:38,754
×ÖÄ»
You got any food? Cold cuts?

287
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:41,140
×ÖÄ»
No, but I think I have some pizza from election night.

288
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:44,810
×ÖÄ»
I think this date's gonna be fun.

289
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:47,430
×ÖÄ»
Let's take a shot. You look nice.

290
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:48,898
×ÖÄ»
- Thanks. - To...

291
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,233
×ÖÄ»
True love. Sex with new people.

292
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:51,484
×ÖÄ»
Danny.

293
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:52,852
×ÖÄ»
Hey, guys.

294
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:53,986
×ÖÄ»
- Hi. - Hey.

295
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:55,321
×ÖÄ»
Lucy, you remember Danny. Danny, Lucy.

296
00:08:55,322 --> 00:08:58,007
×ÖÄ»
- Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

297
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:00,843
×ÖÄ»
Beautiful. Oh, man.

298
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:02,295
×ÖÄ»
What?

299
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:03,846
×ÖÄ»
That's a king salmon over there.

300
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:04,931
×ÖÄ»
So?

301
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:06,515
×ÖÄ»
Jillian studied the migration of that fish.

302
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:07,934
×ÖÄ»
No. Yeah. That fish goes from salt water...

303
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:09,135
×ÖÄ»
No. Stop it. To fresh water.

304
00:09:09,186 --> 00:09:10,770
×ÖÄ»
It's an amazing fish.

305
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:11,804
×ÖÄ»
They do it to mate. Nobody cares.

306
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:12,805
×ÖÄ»
To mate. Danny, nobody cares.

307
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:13,890
×ÖÄ»
- Hey. - Hey, guys?

308
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:14,891
×ÖÄ»
Is everything okay?

309
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:16,142
×ÖÄ»
Really good.

310
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:17,476
×ÖÄ»
Would you mind switching seats with me?

311
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:19,445
×ÖÄ»
Because that fish is in my eye line,

312
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:21,030
×ÖÄ»
just putting me in a...

313
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,865
×ÖÄ»
A bad place emotionally right now.

314
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,033
×ÖÄ»
The fish?

315
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:25,868
×ÖÄ»
That one, yeah. Yeah?

316
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,320
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, sure. It's your eye line. Do you mind?

317
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:29,705
×ÖÄ»
Okay, great. Thanks.

318
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,739
×ÖÄ»
Wouldn't want to look

319
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:31,908
×ÖÄ»
at something I didn't like.

320
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:33,876
×ÖÄ»
Oh, yeah, thank you. That's much better.

321
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:35,494
×ÖÄ»
Good.

322
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:38,581
×ÖÄ»
So can I ask what exactly your problem is

323
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:39,882
×ÖÄ»
with sea life?

324
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,451
×ÖÄ»
Oh, it's just, my ex was an oceanographer.

325
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:43,502
×ÖÄ»
It's stupid.

326
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:44,552
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, it is stupid.

327
00:09:44,554 --> 00:09:45,888
×ÖÄ»
Hey, look at this bread selection.

328
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,890
×ÖÄ»
There's white bread. There's the brown bread.

329
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:50,343
×ÖÄ»
Just if I keep myself from seeing triggers,

330
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:51,727
×ÖÄ»
then, you know,

331
00:09:51,762 --> 00:09:52,761
×ÖÄ»
I don't fixate on her...

332
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:53,896
×ÖÄ»
Ow!

333
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:55,398
×ÖÄ»
Did somebody just kick me?

334
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:56,565
×ÖÄ»
You okay? Ow!

335
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:57,650
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, that is so weird.

336
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,402
×ÖÄ»
I think that maybe we should move tables,

337
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:01,520
×ÖÄ»
or we could try not talking about exes

338
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:03,639
×ÖÄ»
and see if the kicking stops. You know what, though?

339
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,908
×ÖÄ»
I have found that the hardest breakups

340
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,243
×ÖÄ»
are the ones where you might have

341
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:09,078
×ÖÄ»
underestimated the person while you were with them,

342
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:10,312
×ÖÄ»
I don't know if...

343
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:12,081
×ÖÄ»
Yes. That's exactly what I'm going through.

344
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:14,149
×ÖÄ»
- Really? - Yes.

345
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,317
×ÖÄ»
It... it's like you're...

346
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:16,535
×ÖÄ»
I know, it's so weird.

347
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:17,987
×ÖÄ»
That's exactly what is going on

348
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:19,538
×ÖÄ»
with me and Jillian. No way.

349
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,123
×ÖÄ»
Well, it was me, really. I just...

350
00:10:21,124 --> 00:10:22,258
×ÖÄ»
Tell me about that.

351
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:23,659
×ÖÄ»
- Uh, Jamie? - Yeah.

352
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,794
×ÖÄ»
I don't want to jinx this,

353
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:26,379
×ÖÄ»
but I think match-dot-Mindy

354
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,546
×ÖÄ»
might have another success story.

355
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:29,765
×ÖÄ»
You know, you can have a friendship, maybe.

356
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,684
×ÖÄ»
Yeah?

357
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:32,868
×ÖÄ»
So, Morgan, you want to take

358
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:34,203
×ÖÄ»
this girl to the batting cages.

359
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:35,388
×ÖÄ»
I'm still not sure what those are.

360
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:36,939
×ÖÄ»
Three-pronged attack, Morgan.

361
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,641
×ÖÄ»
Number one, casual approach.

362
00:10:38,642 --> 00:10:39,892
×ÖÄ»
Watch me, watch me, watch me.

363
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:41,277
×ÖÄ»
What am I doing? What am I doing?

364
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:42,311
×ÖÄ»
What am I doing? I don't know what you're gonna...

365
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:43,646
×ÖÄ»
Now.

366
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:45,064
×ÖÄ»
Wow, okay, you look like Joe Biden.

367
00:10:45,065 --> 00:10:46,232
×ÖÄ»
That is awesome.

368
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:49,652
×ÖÄ»
Number two, initiate some light physical contact.

369
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:50,653
×ÖÄ»
- Okay. - Oh, red.

370
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:51,954
×ÖÄ»
Nice color. Oh, yeah.

371
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,456
×ÖÄ»
It's Valentine's day, and it hides the blood.

372
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,742
×ÖÄ»
That's disgusting. Number three. Offer her something small.

373
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,828
×ÖÄ»
A token of sorts. It establishes a debt.

374
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:01,247
×ÖÄ»
Got a free cola from the vending machine.

375
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:03,416
×ÖÄ»
Oh, I've actually been staring at that thing all morning.

376
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:05,751
×ÖÄ»
Thanks, doc. I owe you one.

377
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,753
×ÖÄ»
Oh! It's a... Part of the routine.

378
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:08,921
×ÖÄ»
- There it is. - Okay.

379
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:09,972
×ÖÄ»
It's the debt. I got it.

380
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:11,687
×ÖÄ»
You just give her whatever you have on you.

381
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,009
×ÖÄ»
Why not? All right.

382
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,063
×ÖÄ»
So I'll be like, "Hey, this is for you."

383
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:19,932
×ÖÄ»
Where's the body?

384
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,383
×ÖÄ»
I just found the head in the toilet.

385
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:22,768
×ÖÄ»
Oh, God.

386
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:24,720
×ÖÄ»
You never know a love song

387
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:25,938
×ÖÄ»
until you have a broken heart, right?

388
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,239
×ÖÄ»
Mm, yes.

389
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,025
×ÖÄ»
And finally you realize that all of these songs

390
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,409
×ÖÄ»
that you thought were so happy-sounding

391
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,744
×ÖÄ»
are actually so sad.

392
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:33,279
×ÖÄ»
Like you can call me Al. Mm.

393
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,448
×ÖÄ»
"Where is my wife and family?

394
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:36,782
×ÖÄ»
What if I die here?"

395
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,584
×ÖÄ»
Who'll be my role model now that my... once my...

396
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:40,119
×ÖÄ»
Role model's gone?

397
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,504
×ÖÄ»
Man, I gotta download that album again. Mm-hmm.

398
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:42,505
×ÖÄ»
It's a great one.

399
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:44,073
×ÖÄ»
I think they really like each other.

400
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:45,374
×ÖÄ»
Well, they like Paul Simon.

401
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,575
×ÖÄ»
So does everyone else on the planet.

402
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:48,019
×ÖÄ»
No, it's like we're not even here.

403
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,128
×ÖÄ»
Hey, guys.

404
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,429
×ÖÄ»
Hey, there's four of us here.

405
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,514
×ÖÄ»
So let's try to... Oh.

406
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:53,265
×ÖÄ»
Sorry. Oh, it's okay.

407
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,518
×ÖÄ»
Danny was just helping me

408
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,520
×ÖÄ»
figure out where I should get my first tattoo.

409
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:58,604
×ÖÄ»
Uh-oh.

410
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:00,856
×ÖÄ»
Um, you hate tattoos.

411
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:02,074
×ÖÄ»
I don't think so.

412
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:03,992
×ÖÄ»
I think I'm gonna get a tattoo as we.

413
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:05,661
×ÖÄ»
A little butterfly on the nape of my neck,

414
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:07,263
×ÖÄ»
and it would signify that I'm a free spirit...

415
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:08,531
×ÖÄ»
What tattoo are you gonna get?

416
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:11,684
×ÖÄ»
Well, I think I should keep it a secret,

417
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:12,768
×ÖÄ»
because where I want to get it,

418
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:14,169
×ÖÄ»
only certain people would see it.

419
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:16,605
×ÖÄ»
I-I don't know, Luce.

420
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:18,808
×ÖÄ»
I worry that a tattoo is a little short-sighted.

421
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:20,526
×ÖÄ»
You know? Mmm. Can I try that?

422
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,894
×ÖÄ»
Is your grandson really gonna understand

423
00:12:21,945 --> 00:12:23,562
×ÖÄ»
why you have a radiohead lyric

424
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:25,064
×ÖÄ»
under your belly button?

425
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,148
×ÖÄ»
I can't understand radiohead now.

426
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:27,400
×ÖÄ»
Mmm!

427
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:29,618
×ÖÄ»
Do you wanna have some of my COD?

428
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:31,370
×ÖÄ»
I'm fine. I just had some.

429
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:34,206
×ÖÄ»
Wow, that lamb is so, mmm, succulent.

430
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,658
×ÖÄ»
It is succulent.

431
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:37,326
×ÖÄ»
You are such a good orderer. Thank you.

432
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,027
×ÖÄ»
Pick a good restaurant, and they say, you know,

433
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:40,162
×ÖÄ»
the food orders itself, so...

434
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,548
×ÖÄ»
Mmm, try this. Okay.

435
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:44,032
×ÖÄ»
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Lucy!

436
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,501
×ÖÄ»
- Your cold. - Hmm?

437
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:46,702
×ÖÄ»
She had this horrible cold last week.

438
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,753
×ÖÄ»
I'm good with it. I'll take it.

439
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:49,004
×ÖÄ»
You might get something.

440
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:50,423
×ÖÄ»
I'm not sick. Do you want some of my COD?

441
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:51,807
×ÖÄ»
I don't get sick that often. I don't have a cold.

442
00:12:51,808 --> 00:12:52,808
×ÖÄ»
- You don't? - No.

443
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,042
×ÖÄ»
Eat off my fork. It's romantic.

444
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:55,644
×ÖÄ»
I don't need it. I'm not hungry.

445
00:12:55,645 --> 00:12:57,430
×ÖÄ»
Eat off my fork, please.

446
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,898
×ÖÄ»
Isn't that good?

447
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,067
×ÖÄ»
You all right, buddy?

448
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:03,736
×ÖÄ»
It was just a little piece of COD.

449
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,053
×ÖÄ»
I'm so sorry. It's got bones in it. That's why.

450
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:06,188
×ÖÄ»
Hey, Jamie? Are you good?

451
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:07,239
×ÖÄ»
You choking, buddy?

452
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:08,441
×ÖÄ»
They're doctors. You should just...

453
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:09,658
×ÖÄ»
Okay?

454
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:11,360
×ÖÄ»
You sure?

455
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:12,661
×ÖÄ»
I'm gonna... It has bones in it.

456
00:13:12,662 --> 00:13:13,896
×ÖÄ»
I can Heimlich. I know. Please let me Heimlich you.

457
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,414
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

458
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,583
×ÖÄ»
I'm not gonna let you die in this weird restaurant, Jamie.

459
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,201
×ÖÄ»
Should we get dessert?

460
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:21,036
×ÖÄ»
I think he's choking.

461
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:22,738
×ÖÄ»
No, he's okay.

462
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:24,039
×ÖÄ»
Jamie, stop!

463
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,124
×ÖÄ»
Jamie!

464
00:13:25,175 --> 00:13:26,258
×ÖÄ»
- Oh. - Oh, boy.

465
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:28,761
×ÖÄ»
Jamie, please stop doing that!

466
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:30,379
×ÖÄ»
Hey, guys, don't worry about it.

467
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,747
×ÖÄ»
She's a doctor. She's got it.

468
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,509
×ÖÄ»
I just don't understand why, in 2013,

469
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,028
×ÖÄ»
restaurants have any bones in their fish.

470
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,529
×ÖÄ»
And while I appreciate the gift certificate

471
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,680
×ÖÄ»
as a gesture,

472
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,282
×ÖÄ»
I did think the manager was passive-aggressive,

473
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,349
×ÖÄ»
the way that he gave it.

474
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,350
×ÖÄ»
You remember that?

475
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,736
×ÖÄ»
Hey, you know what?

476
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,371
×ÖÄ»
I think I'm gonna call it a night, Jamie.

477
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:52,488
×ÖÄ»
You almost died.

478
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:54,374
×ÖÄ»
My shoes are pinching me.

479
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:56,159
×ÖÄ»
- So... - No. No. No.

480
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:57,460
×ÖÄ»
We're gonna continue this date.

481
00:13:57,494 --> 00:14:00,129
×ÖÄ»
I am gonna take you to the most romantic place

482
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,530
×ÖÄ»
in all of New York City.

483
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,800
×ÖÄ»
And possibly the world.

484
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,968
×ÖÄ»
Keep moving, guys.

485
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:09,055
×ÖÄ»
Please, keep the line moving.

486
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,923
×ÖÄ»
Jamie, I cannot believe you took me

487
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:13,843
×ÖÄ»
to the empire state building for Valentine's day.

488
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:15,377
×ÖÄ»
Last year, the guy I was with,

489
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:16,679
×ÖÄ»
he took me to an Indian casino,

490
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,147
×ÖÄ»
and I lost $2,000.

491
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,548
×ÖÄ»
Well, this is actually

492
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:20,733
×ÖÄ»
something I've always wanted to do.

493
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:23,403
×ÖÄ»
And I figured I'd come with the perfect person

494
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,487
×ÖÄ»
on the perfect night.

495
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,490
×ÖÄ»
Next, please.

496
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,058
×ÖÄ»
Wait, wait. Jamie.

497
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:31,611
×ÖÄ»
Um, before we go into the most romantic building

498
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:33,162
×ÖÄ»
on the entire planet... Yeah.

499
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,396
×ÖÄ»
Can you just tell me one thing? Yeah.

500
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:37,366
×ÖÄ»
Just... you're not in love with Lucy, are you?

501
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:38,451
×ÖÄ»
Next, please.

502
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:39,836
×ÖÄ»
Why do you keep saying things like that?

503
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,671
×ÖÄ»
It just seems like you were really jealous

504
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,712
×ÖÄ»
of her and Danny at dinner.

505
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,340
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I'm not jealous of a guy

506
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,558
×ÖÄ»
who wears boot cut jeans, all right?

507
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:46,692
×ÖÄ»
See? That sounds jealous.

508
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:48,111
×ÖÄ»
Lucy is my best friend.

509
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:49,345
×ÖÄ»
Next. And if I love her,

510
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,707
×ÖÄ»
it's the way I would love a sister.

511
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:53,232
×ÖÄ»
I have a brother, and if rishi looked at me that way,

512
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,400
×ÖÄ»
I would have to talk to our dad.

513
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:56,119
×ÖÄ»
Next, next!

514
00:14:56,153 --> 00:14:57,520
×ÖÄ»
Let's go, lady. Come on.

515
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,854
×ÖÄ»
Okay, we're trying to sort something out right now.

516
00:14:58,855 --> 00:14:59,906
×ÖÄ»
All right? Can you just give me a break here?

517
00:14:59,907 --> 00:15:01,357
×ÖÄ»
Just look into your lover's eyes.

518
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,909
×ÖÄ»
It's Valentine's day, for God's sake. Come on.

519
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,210
×ÖÄ»
Quick scenario, okay?

520
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:06,712
×ÖÄ»
You are on death row because you murdered a cop.

521
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:08,464
×ÖÄ»
What? This is hypothetical.

522
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:09,999
×ÖÄ»
You can only see one more person before they electrocute you.

523
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
×ÖÄ»
Who would it be?

524
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,135
×ÖÄ»
My lawyer

525
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:13,336
×ÖÄ»
because I wouldn't do something like that.

526
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,554
×ÖÄ»
Okay, your lawyer bungled the case,

527
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:16,923
×ÖÄ»
and you have one person to see before you die.

528
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:19,759
×ÖÄ»
You can say me if it's me.

529
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:28,484
×ÖÄ»
It's Lucy.

530
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:29,652
×ÖÄ»
I knew it.

531
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:30,903
×ÖÄ»
You're good at this.

532
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:32,271
×ÖÄ»
It's Lucy!

533
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:34,106
×ÖÄ»
I'm in love with Lucy!

534
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,326
×ÖÄ»
No, no, no, it's okay. Don't...

535
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:38,411
×ÖÄ»
I'm not Lucy.

536
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,863
×ÖÄ»
No, I mean, it's not...

537
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:41,863
×ÖÄ»
It's not, like, traumatizing.

538
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:43,166
×ÖÄ»
It's okay. It's not...

539
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,200
×ÖÄ»
It's just... I'm okay with it.

540
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:47,286
×ÖÄ»
Okay, folks. Next.

541
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:48,621
×ÖÄ»
Come on, let's go.

542
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:51,707
×ÖÄ»
I'm a man in love!

543
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,742
×ÖÄ»
Oh, my God!

544
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:54,844
×ÖÄ»
Jamie!

545
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:56,345
×ÖÄ»
This has not been a good day for you.

546
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:57,463
×ÖÄ»
Okay, all right.

547
00:15:57,514 --> 00:15:59,015
×ÖÄ»
That's it, Morgan.

548
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:01,601
×ÖÄ»
Casual approach.

549
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:02,685
×ÖÄ»
Okay, good.

550
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,103
×ÖÄ»
Now some light contact.

551
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,355
×ÖÄ»
Light.

552
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:07,523
×ÖÄ»
What are you doing?

553
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:09,308
×ÖÄ»
Morgan, human touching, not dog touching.

554
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,227
×ÖÄ»
Agh.

555
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:14,197
×ÖÄ»
Good... good... Good recovery, I guess.

556
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:15,648
×ÖÄ»
Now parting gift, parting gift.

557
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:17,450
×ÖÄ»
Come on, Morgan. Come on.

558
00:16:17,484 --> 00:16:19,952
×ÖÄ»
Oh, he found the body.

559
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:22,238
×ÖÄ»
She's into it. Who knew? Okay.

560
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,739
×ÖÄ»
I... it worked!

561
00:16:23,773 --> 00:16:25,608
×ÖÄ»
Bravo, Morgan! Bravo.

562
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,110
×ÖÄ»
Hey, man, I'm working here. Sorry.

563
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:31,047
×ÖÄ»
You finally came for me, love!

564
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:32,915
×ÖÄ»
Okay, shh. You finally called my name!

565
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,166
×ÖÄ»
Shh. Come on, come on.

566
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,635
×ÖÄ»
You're gonna wake up my neighbors.

567
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,670
×ÖÄ»
I can't believe this is all because of you.

568
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:38,888
×ÖÄ»
You showed me that love

569
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,423
×ÖÄ»
was right in front

570
00:16:40,424 --> 00:16:41,474
×ÖÄ»
of my face.

571
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:42,725
×ÖÄ»
All right, that's so great.

572
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,343
×ÖÄ»
I never thought I would feel this way, Mindy.

573
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,678
×ÖÄ»
We can just walk. It is great.

574
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,812
×ÖÄ»
And not dance and stuff.

575
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,382
×ÖÄ»
I've never done anything like this.

576
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:49,482
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

577
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:50,633
×ÖÄ»
The whole time. Disgusting, water on my...

578
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,817
×ÖÄ»
It's all because of you.

579
00:16:51,818 --> 00:16:53,486
×ÖÄ»
You are such an important character

580
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,803
×ÖÄ»
in the story of Lucy and me.

581
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:56,439
×ÖÄ»
Don't you realize that?

582
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,740
×ÖÄ»
Yeah. You're fate's helper.

583
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:59,275
×ÖÄ»
I'm like the Joan Cusack character

584
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:01,577
×ÖÄ»
in the romantic comedy of your life, yeah.

585
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:03,246
×ÖÄ»
Yes! I can't believe it.

586
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:04,480
×ÖÄ»
Can you believe this is me?

587
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,748
×ÖÄ»
People are gonna think you're on drugs.

588
00:17:05,749 --> 00:17:06,916
×ÖÄ»
I'm in love! Stop it, Jamie.

589
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,418
×ÖÄ»
I'm flying.

590
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:13,289
×ÖÄ»
Oh, my God.

591
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:19,922
×ÖÄ»
Hey! What the hell, you guys?

592
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:21,640
×ÖÄ»
Hey, what's going on, love birds?

593
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:23,009
×ÖÄ»
Actually, we kind of broke up.

594
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,210
×ÖÄ»
And, for the record, there is no kissing on my stoop.

595
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,013
×ÖÄ»
That is a direct quote from my super.

596
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,681
×ÖÄ»
Okay, well, I left my gloves at your place.

597
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:29,932
×ÖÄ»
So I just came here to pick them up.

598
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,934
×ÖÄ»
Did you think you would find them inside of her mouth?

599
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:34,153
×ÖÄ»
You're making out with this guy?

600
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,155
×ÖÄ»
This guy, they ask if he wanted a cocktail,

601
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,239
×ÖÄ»
and he ordered shrimp?

602
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:39,942
×ÖÄ»
Why are you yelling? Because I love you!

603
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:45,281
×ÖÄ»
Really?

604
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,036
×ÖÄ»
Okay, wait a minute.

605
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,403
×ÖÄ»
I love you too!

606
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,289
×ÖÄ»
Whoa, whoa, guys, we were just kissing a second ago.

607
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,591
×ÖÄ»
All right, I'm gonna call it a night and head in.

608
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,959
×ÖÄ»
Pardon me. God, I've been dreaming about this

609
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,427
×ÖÄ»
for 15 years!

610
00:17:58,428 --> 00:18:00,079
×ÖÄ»
Okay, can I... what made you change your mind?

611
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,246
×ÖÄ»
Can I squeeze by here? My life flashed before my eyes

612
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,548
×ÖÄ»
when I was choking.

613
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,083
×ÖÄ»
Just... it suddenly dawned on me. Excuse me.

614
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:05,601
×ÖÄ»
Not to be a stickler,

615
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:06,802
×ÖÄ»
but I-I was the person

616
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:08,253
×ÖÄ»
who helped make it dawn on you.

617
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:09,522
×ÖÄ»
Mindy helped. She was like a supporting character.

618
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:10,723
×ÖÄ»
Oh, thank you!

619
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,141
×ÖÄ»
Let's take a walk. Let's just get outta here.

620
00:18:12,142 --> 00:18:13,926
×ÖÄ»
That's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

621
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,778
×ÖÄ»
You know, I feel like if I had just worn the first dress,

622
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:17,196
×ÖÄ»
that this wouldn't have been the situation.

623
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:20,432
×ÖÄ»
I don't think that's the problem.

624
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,368
×ÖÄ»
Hey, Dr. Reed. Morgan.

625
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,703
×ÖÄ»
I'm gonna go pick up three or four calzones

626
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,372
×ÖÄ»
and crawl into bed.

627
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,940
×ÖÄ»
Who am I kidding? It's gonna be four.

628
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,291
×ÖÄ»
What happened? Did you strike out?

629
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,210
×ÖÄ»
Ha. My first sports analogy.

630
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,378
×ÖÄ»
I had her right where I wanted her.

631
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,629
×ÖÄ»
And then, bam!

632
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,831
×ÖÄ»
She dumps me literally the second

633
00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:36,949
×ÖÄ»
we're finished having sex.

634
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:38,450
×ÖÄ»
Whoa, whoa, wait.

635
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,718
×ÖÄ»
What... sex?

636

×ÖÄ»
I did everything you told me.

637
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:41,954
×ÖÄ»
I was playing it cool.

638
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,556

×ÖÄ»
The batting cages is the good stuff.

646
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:57,770

I don't want to have sex with someone I care about

647
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:58,804

in a mop closet.

648

×ÖÄ»
I want to do it the right way.

649
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,657

I feel like I've led you astray.

654

Another one, another one.

659

×ÖÄ»
Oh! Oh, God!

667

to spending Valentine's day at the empire state building.

672

×ÖÄ»
Who told you the empire state building was romantic?

00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,459
×ÖÄ»
A postcard at the airport gift shop?

680
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,194
×ÖÄ»
Some dumb movie with tom Hanks

681
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,246

×ÖÄ»
Why do you need to take a picture of everything?

×ÖÄ»
Like a barbershop

716
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:03,128
×ÖÄ»
or an ATM shelter

717
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,380
