00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,610
我是黛比・韦弗
My name is Debbie Weaver.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,850
这是我的家人
This is my family.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,170
这是我们过去在新泽西贝永的家
This is our old apartment in Bayonne, New Jersey.

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,870
我丈夫马蒂在镇上给我们找了一个新房子
My husband Marty got us a deal on a town house...

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,090
邻居和蔼 街道宽阔
nicer neighborhood, wider streets.

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,860
只有一个小小的问题
Just one little problem...

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,090
我们的邻居全部来自另一个星球
our neighbors are all from another planet...

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,700
这不是玩笑
Literally.

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,200
姜饼人

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,260
伯克小学

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,640
马蒂看啊
Look at this, Marty.

12
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,070
我们在这可以做很多事
There's so much to volunteer for.

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,090
在这里我们也许真的可以做些有意义的事呢
We could make a real difference at this school.

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,970
这真无聊 人类真是无趣 
This is boring. Humans are boring.

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,320
拉里・伯德太淡定了
Larry Bird is underwhelmed.

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,200
那你怎么不找点有趣的事去做?
Well, why don't you find something that interests you?

17
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,890
比如 我们准备参加家长教师联谊会
Yeah, like, I think we're gonna join the P.T.A.

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,660
你想说啥?
What? What was that?

19
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,020
不好说 家教会?
I don't know. The P.T.A.?

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,870
也许今年我们可以尝试下别的事情
I mean, maybe this year we should volunteer for different things.

21
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,860
我可以去教足球
You know? I could coach soccer.

22
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,480
噢 当教练
Oh, coaching.

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,620
好吧 你有意见? 
Okay, what was that?

24
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,940
我喜欢你做教练 好喜欢
I love when you coach. Love it.

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,700
是你说要做点有意义的事情
Well, you talk about making a difference.

26
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,060
做教练很有意义
Well, coaching is it.

27
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,960
还有什么比运动
What's better than molding young minds

28
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,700
更能磨练孩子们的意志 是吧?
through organized athletics, right?

29
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,270
- 噢 听起来不错 - 马蒂 拜托
- Oh, that sounds interesting. - Come on, Marty.

30
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,230
只不过就是你一边吹哨子 孩子们一边
It's you blowing a whistle while a bunch of kids

31
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,730
像一群疯牛一样在球场上乱跑
run across a field like a herd of confused cattle.

32
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,450
你当他们是曼联队啊
It's hardly Manchester United.

33
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,890
家长教师协会又是做什么的?
What does this, uh, P.T.A. do exactly?

34
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,400
- 帮助学校... - 点心义卖
- It helps the school... - Bake sales.

35
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,800
点心义卖只是其中一个很小的部分
Bake sales are a small part of it.

36
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,600
可以借此开展文化项目
It's also a chance to install an arts program.

37
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,160
是啊 之后就是你争我吵 勾心斗角
Yeah, and get mired in bickering and petty politics.

38
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,580
你争我吵 勾心斗角? 听上去真不错
Bickering and petty politics? Oh, that sounds delightful.

39
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,680
就像察布隆伊恩的议会
Just like zabvronian council.

40
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,930
夫人 我和黛比・韦弗去参加家长教师联谊会
Wife, I think I will join Debbie Weaver on this T.P.A.,

41
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,950
而你可以和马蒂教孩子们踢球 
and you can coach soccer with Marty.

42
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,960
噢 太好了!
Oh, excellent!

43
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,310
等会儿 你对运动了解吗?
Now hold on. Do you even know anything about sports?

44
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,820
当然 小时候我并不是很出众
Oh, yes. I was nothing exceptional as a child,

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,790
但体育极大地补足了我的自信
but sports gave me some much-needed self-esteem.

46
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,220
真希望我们的小迪克也能像我一样
I was hoping that our little Dick might follow in my footsteps.

47
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,140
你为啥和我过不去?
Why are you fighting me?

48
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,760
保重 教练
Good luck, coach.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,950
呃 都是陈词滥调
Well, this is boilerplate stuff.

50
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,290
你说察布隆伊恩的议会也兴这一套?
You say this is similar to your Zabvronian council?

51
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,920
那你应该能很快适应这儿
You should have no trouble keeping up.

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,640
你们的"希望屠夫"呢?
Where's your butcher of hope?

53
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,870
高个子 戴着黑色兜帽 来隐藏他无尽的悲伤
Tall chap, wears a dark hood to mask his eternal sorrow.

54
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,950
所有争论的终结者
Puts an end to debates.

55
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,220
没有他 会议怎么能正常进行?
How can you have a proper meeting without a butcher of hope?

56
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,410
也许先跳过这项
Maybe skim this.

57
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,600
下一项议程是 点心义卖 筹资买新球服
The next item on the agenda is the bake sale for the new soccer uniforms.

58
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,840
经过深思熟虑
Now, after giving it a lot of thought,

59
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,590
我决定卖巧克力饼
I've decided we'll sell brownies.

60
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,480
都同意是吗?
All in favor?

61
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,850
打搅一下 我叫黛比・韦弗
Ooh! Excuse me. I'm Debbie Weaver,

62
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,570
- 马克斯和艾比的妈妈 - 你好黛比
- Max and Abby's mom. - Hello, Debbie.

63
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,650
虽然我不认识你的孩子 但你肯定告诉过他们
I don't know your children, but I'm sure you've taught them

64
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,710
打断别人说话是很失礼的
how rude it is to interrupt someone.

65
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,840
哦 呵呵
Oh. Fun.

66
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,960
好的 我有个想法
Well, uh, okay. I have a couple of ideas.

67
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,860
原来在贝永的学校
Back at our old school in Bayonne,

68
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,940
我们都用姜饼作主打
we made gingerbread cookies for the bake sale,

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,420
姜饼做成球队的形状
and we decorated them like the soccer team,

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,470
很受孩子们欢迎
and the kids loved 'em.

71
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,680
所以每次都能赚到很多...
And we ended up making a lot of m...

72
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,170
钱
Money.

73
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,620
我们做了...
We made...

74
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,760
很多...
it was a lot of...

75
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,930
姜饼... 都很好吃
They were... delicious.

76
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,920
原来主席就是你们的"希望屠夫"
The president has become your butcher of hope.

77
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,820
- 这可不是好兆头 - 闭嘴!
- Nothing good can come of this. - Just zip it!

78
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,980
谢谢你 黛比
Thank you, Debbie.

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,610
在贝永 你们能就地取材做点心
I'm sure in Bayonne, you used what you had,

80
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,770
我很佩服 但这里的情况不同
and I admire that, but we have different standards here.

81
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,840
所以还是做巧克力饼吧
So we'll be making brownies.

82
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,680
太不讲理了! 马蒂是对的
This is ridiculous! Marty was right.

83
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,950
家教会果然尽是勾心斗角 我们走
The P.T.A. Is just petty politics. Let's go.

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,920
不能善罢甘休
We shall do no such thing.

85
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,950
这女人不仅否定你的观点
This woman is not only attacking your idea,

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,290
还否定了你 你的生活方式和你的孩子
she's attacking your very being, your way of life, your children.

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,170
她只是喜欢巧克力饼罢了
I think she just likes brownies.

88
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,960
抱歉
Excuse me.

89
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,460
协会手册规定
According to your guidelines,

90
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,640
与筹资相关的任何议程
any decisions regarding fund-raising

91
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,120
需由全体人员投票表决
must be voted upon by the entire group.

92
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,020
因此 我动议 通过投票... 
Therefore, I move we vote...

93
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,810
来决定是卖姜饼还是巧克力饼
gingerbread men or brownies?

94
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,880
我附议
I second the motion.

95
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,760
好 下周进行投票
Fine. Next week, you'll have your vote.

96
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,690
- 现在咋办? - 分而治之
- What do we do now? - Divide and conquer.

97
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,650
只要琳达不在 说服他们就会简单些
When Linda's not around, it'll be easier to convince them.

98
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,940
我们一个一个拿下他们
We'll go after them separately.

99
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,810
一个一个搞定
Ooh! Pick 'em off one by one.

100
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,830
是的 只要我俩齐心 银河系唾手可得
Yes, and together, we shall rule the galaxy.

101
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,460
- 啥? - 没啥
- What? - What?

102
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,220
小伙子们 跑起来!
Keep moving, guys!

103
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,040
跑起来! 传球!
Keep it going! Pass the ball!

104
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,080
干的不错 迪克踢得不错
Nice work, Dick. Way to get a piece of that ball.

105
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,700
你真棒
It's a great job.

106
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,530
我不懂 真心不懂
I'm confused. I'm very confused.

107
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,170
看上去 迪克表现很糟
It would appear that Dick is not doing a great job.

108
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,840
实际上 他是队里最差的球员
In fact, I would say that he is the worst player on the team,

109
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,490
但你仍说他做的很好
and yet you keep lying about his performance.

110
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,370
听着 杰西 做教练就是要积极强化
Listen, Jackie, coaching's about positive reinforcement.

111
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,490
好吧 说实话 这孩子绝对成不了贝克汉姆
Okay, let's face it, kid's never gonna be David Beckham.

112
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,830
我们本准备给他起这个名字的
We almost named him David Beckham.

113
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,810
我倒觉得 只要稍加训练
As a matter of fact, I think with some practice,

114
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,070
迪克就可以成为地球上最伟大的球员
Dick could be the greatest soccer player the world has ever seen.

115
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,080
实则不然
Yeah, not so much.

116
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,410
要是我 我就不会抱这么高的...期望
I would lower those expectations... a lot.

117
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,840
也许以后 他会长得像大卫・贝克汉姆
Well, maybe he could at least grow up to look like David Beckham.

118
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,690
不太可能吧
Mm, nope.

119
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,080
不过也许我们鼓励他 他会玩的很开心呢
But if we encourage him, he'll probably have a good time.

120
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,250
加油 小伙子们 跑起来 动起来
Come on, guys, keep it going! Move it along!

121
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,610
拦住球 迪克!
Get the ball, Dick!

122
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,010
就是这样! 漂亮 迪克!
That's it! Way to go, Dick!

123
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,280
小伙子 你这次都快碰到球了呢
You almost made contact that time, buddy!

124
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,280
谢谢 感觉好多了 教练
Thanks. Felt great, coach.

125
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,020
好吧 真心不是贝克汉姆的料
Yeah, not David Beckham.

126
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,970
记住 你比那些女人强大 黛比・韦弗
Remember, you are stronger than these women, Debbie Weaver.

127
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,620
她们要么听你的话 要么领略你的怒火
They must do your bidding or feel your wrath.

128
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,320
噢 谢了 拉里 
Oh, thanks, Larry.

129
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,060
有个男人在背后支持的感觉真好
You know, it's nice to have a man supporting me on this.

130
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,890
我牙上有口红吗?
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

131
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,920
有 我还以为你是故意抹的
Yes, but I thought that was on purpose.

132
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,310
嗨 伊丽莎白
Hi... Elizabeth.

133
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,660
很抱歉来打扰你
I'm sorry to bother you at home,

134
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,230
不过我们想说你有没有个一两分钟
but we were wondering if you had a few minutes

135
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,950
来谈谈点心义卖的事
to talk about the bake sale.

136
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,050
我真的不太关心这事儿
I really haven't thought much about it.

137
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,700
我一般跟着琳达投票 等我决定好会告知你的
I usually just vote with Linda, but I'll let you know.

138
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,530
伊丽莎白 黛比・韦弗为了见你
Elizabeth, Debbie Weaver has spent all morning

139
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,660
花了一早上的时间给牙齿涂口红
putting lipstick on her teeth to come talk to you.

140
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,260
我恳请你听她说完
I insist you hear her out.

141
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,310
他对家教会超级上心的
He's very passionate about the P.T.A.

142
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,140
好吧
Okay.

143
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,380
不过上次我投琳达反对票
But the last time I voted against Linda,

144
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,770
我女儿可是一整年没有玩伴
my daughter didn't have a playdate for, like, a year.

145
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,330
她又矮又胖 她需要尽可能多的朋友
She's kinda chunky. She needs all the friends she can get.

146
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,510
这正是整件事如此重要的原因
And that's why this is so important,

147
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,700
- 因为家教会是为所有人服务的 - 所有人
- because the P.T.A. is about everyone. - Everyone.

148
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,020
不是一个人
Not just one person.

149
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,920
对 今天只是个饼干
Yes, today it's about cookies.

150
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,430
明天也许是禁止你的胖丫头上学校年鉴
Tomorrow it's banning your potbellied daughter from the yearbook.

151
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,310
伊丽莎白 将心比心
Elizabeth, mother to mother,

152
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,770
我们不能让琳达得逞
we can't let Linda get away with this.

153
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,300
进来吧
Come in.

154
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,290
太棒了
Excellent.

155
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,570
再说 姜饼干比巧克力蛋糕卡路里少多了
Plus gingerbread cookies have fewer calories than brownies.

156
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,650
我知道你喜欢给孩子吃健康食品
I know you like to feed your kids healthy foods.

157
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,100
我知道你有一个博客专门讲这个
I know you have a blog about it, yeah.

158
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,940
听着 特蕾西 我得去做饭了
Listen, Tracy, I gotta start making dinner.

159
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,360
我指着你投票了好吗
Can I count on your vote?

160
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,640
真的? 太好了 谢谢
Yeah? Great! Thanks!

161
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,740
我滴个神啊 您这短裤
Oh, dear lord, those shorts.

162
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,890
是啊 还挺合身的
Yeah, they still fit.

163
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,560
是吗?
Do they?

164
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,160
- 训练如何? - 太棒了
- How was your practice? - It was awesome.

165
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,850
你猜怎么着? 我真心觉得我做的事特有意义
You know what? I really feel like I'm starting to make a difference.

166
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,340
你呢?你的小饼干生意怎么样啊?
How about you? How is your little, uh, cookie thing coming?

167
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,440
马蒂 那不是小饼干生意好嘛
It's not a little cookie thing, Marty, okay?

168
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,930
我是在争取家教会的民主化
I'm fighting to keep the P.T.A. democratic.

169
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,960
- 没错 用你的姜饼人 - 没错
- Right. With gingerbread man. - That's right.

170
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,220
我是说 我可不穿着女士裤子
I mean, I'm not chasing little kids around

171
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,540
整天追着小孩屁股后面跑...
 in lady pants all day, but...

172
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,680
好嘞 等等 等等 
Okay, hold on, hold on.

173
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,800
我没有穿着女士裤子
I'm not chasing kids around

174
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,420
整天追着小孩屁股后面跑好嘛
in lady pants, okay?

175
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,700
我是在创造一辈子的回忆
I'm creating lifelong memories.

176
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,190
好吧 你看怎么着? 我错了
All right, you know what? I'm sorry.

177
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,860
我很高兴你喜欢当教练
I'm glad that you are enjoying coaching.

178
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,240
我只是觉得我们各做各的事十分明智
I just think it was a good decision for us  to do separate things.

179
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,410
是啊 超赞的决定
 Yeah, it was a great decision,

180
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,110
我也很高兴你喜欢你的家长教师联谊会
and I'm happy that you're enjoying the P.T.A.

181
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,210
我很高兴你高兴我喜欢你的家教会
Well, I'm happy you're happy I'm enjoying the P.T.A.

182
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,930
那么 跟我说说 黛比・韦弗
So, tell me, Debbie Weaver,

183
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,800
姜饼人尝起来跟其他人一样吗?
does gingerbread man taste the same as regular man?

184
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,040
不
No.

185
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,810
你好 黛比
Hello, Debbie.

186
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,720
出门看看另一半人怎么活?
Out seeing how the other half lives?

187
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,970
嗨 琳达 
Hi, Linda.

188
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,280
别告诉我你还在为你的姜饼人召集支持者呢? 
Don't tell me you're still trying to drum up support for your gingerbread cookies?

189
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,170
的确如此
We are.

190
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,920
并且我们已经得到必要的票数
And we've just acquired the necessary votes

191
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,910
来否决你巧克力饼 接受事实吧 夫人
to overrule your brownie mandate, so take that, lady.

192
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,870
我当家长教师联谊会的主席已经好久了
You know, I've been president of the P.T.A. for a long time,

193
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,760
你们这种人我也看多了
and I've seen your type come and go.

194
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,010
你搬到郊区
You move to the suburbs

195
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,220
带来你城里的恶习
and bring the bad ideas from the city with you.

196
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,500
我可不允许这一切发生 明白吗?
Well, I'm not gonna let that happen here, okay?

197
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,930
很好 借过
Great. Beep-beep.

198
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,870
天啊
Ow, God.

199
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,970
主席

200
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,050
她对家教会还真上心
Wow. She's really into the P.T.A.

201
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,200
也许我们就该让她随心所欲
Maybe we should just let her do what she wants.

202
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,750
坚决不行
Absolutely not.

203
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,370
我有把握确保我们成功
I have a plan that will guarantee us victory.

204
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,560
真的? 好吧
Yeah? Okay.

205
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,810
但别做什么怪事
But don't do anything weird.

206
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,410
你就挺怪的
You're weird.

207
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,020
晚上好 夫君
Good evening, husband.

208
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,820
好啊 夫人
Oh, hello, wife.

209
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,430
你看起来心事重重 怎么了?
Oh, you look troubled. What's the matter?

210
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,370
迪克今天参加足球训练
Dick had soccer practice today.

211
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,510
他真的糟透了 但是马蒂・韦弗
And he was really quite awful, but Marty Weaver

212
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,940
一直告诉他做的很好
kept on telling him he was doing a good job.

213
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,530
他把这叫做"积极强化"
He called it "positive reinforcement."

214
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,730
这群人类和他们那套每个人都是独一无二的的鬼话
Oh, these humans and their "everyone's special" baloney.

215
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,940
衰人们 尽情享受被人修理的快乐吧
Have fun sucking hind teat to the rest of the universe, losers.

216
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,890
我十分担心如果迪克在运动方面如此差劲
Uh, I'm very concerned that if Dick is a poor athlete,

217
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,150
他会缺乏自信 就不能成为
he'll lack self-esteem and fail to grow up

218
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,190
像他妈妈一样坚强自信的黑人女性
to be a strong, confident black woman like his mother.

219
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,870
我在运动中找到了自我 我希望他也能如此
I found myself in sport. I was hoping he would, too.

220
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,820
也许该由你来主导局势了
Well, you might need to take more control of the situation.

221
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,100
这些人类太过柔弱 
These humans are surprisingly soft.

222
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,070
他们需要有人强迫他们行动起来
They must be pushed into action.

223
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,850
你知道什么对你儿子是最好的
You know what's best for your son.

224
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,020
你必须强悍起来 绝不手软
You must be fierce and take no prisoners.

225
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,640
- 我不知道 夫君 - 不 你能行的
- Ooh, I don't know, husband. - Yes, you can do this.

226
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,920
坚决果断 绝不手软
Be fierce and take no prisoners.

227
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,900
跟着我说
Say it with me.

228
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,130
- 坚决果断 绝不手软 - 坚决手软..不对...我..对不起
- Be fierce and take no prisoners. - Fierce and prisoners... no... I... sorry.

229
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,770
差不多吧
Well, it's close enough.

230
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,510
如果实在不行
And if all else fails,

231
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,910
在迪克的脑袋里装个运动芯片总是行的
we can always install a performance chip in Dick's brain.

232
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,370
- 谢谢老公 - 不客气 亲爱的
- Thanks, Boo. - Welcome, Snookems.

233
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,620
雷吉・杰克逊 就位了吗?
Reggie Jackson, are you in position?

234
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,540
是的 父亲 目标已锁定
Yes, father. Target acquired.

235
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,390
激活姜饼人装置
Activate gingerbread device.

236
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,110
明白
Understood.

237
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,120
琳达?
Linda?

238
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,730
琳达?
Oh, Linda?

239
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,270
嗨 琳达!
Hi, Linda!

240
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,260
琳达?
Linda?

241
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,750
你好?
Hello?

242
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,170
谁在外面?
Is somebody there?

243
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,540
谁在那儿?
Who's there?

244
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,720
琳达!
Linda!

245
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,290
有人在这儿?
Is somebody here?

246
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,390
你好 琳达
Hello, Linda.

247
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,520
下一个...
The next...

248
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,380
下一个议...议程安排是...
The next item on the age-agenda...

249
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
- 那是什么?! - 什么什么?
- What was that?! - What was what?

250
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,890
她看起来好紧张
She seems so nervous.

251
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,560
- 我想她知道我们拉到票了 - 有可能
- I think she knows we got the votes. - Perhaps.

252
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,730
也可能是因为我昨晚在她家对她做了点什么
Or... perhaps she's suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder

253
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,820
让她现在出现了创伤后应激障碍
from something I may or may not have made happen at her house last night.

254
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,690
你做了什么?
What did you do?

255
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,010
我击败了她
I defeated her.

256
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:03,040
在我们星球 我们通过心理战来打赢战争
Where I'm from, we wage war through psychological destruction.

257
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,980
我们的目标是在精神上重创敌人
Our goal is to mentally crush our enemies

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,530
直到他们无法在社会立足
until they can no longer function in society.

259
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,520
我只是想做姜饼
I just wanted gingerbread cookies.

260
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,170
如你所愿
And gingerbread cookies you shall have.

261
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,310
打扰一下
Excuse me.

262
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,110
我有个关于点心义卖的问题
I have a question regarding the bake sale.

263
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,750
别过来 姜饼人!
Stay away from me, gingerbread man!

264
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,170
家教会是你的了 黛比・韦弗
The P.T.A. is yours, Debbie Weaver.

265
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,730
好吧... 真该死
Well... crap.

266
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,700
我知道你很累 迪克
I know you're tired, Dick,

267
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,710
但这是为了你好
but this is for your own good.

268
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,390
谢谢 妈妈 你说得对
Thank you, mother. You were right.

269
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,210
腹部的疼痛确实会变得麻木
The pain in my side did eventually go numb.

270
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,870
嘿! 这是怎么回事?
Hey! What's going on?

271
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,440
我们在挑战体能极限
We're running motivational laps.

272
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,490
这已经是第三百一十圈了
This is 310.

273
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,870
我在尽我所能保护我的儿子
I'm doing what I must to protect my son.

274
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,050
我不想他重蹈我童年的覆辙
I don't want him to have the same childhood I did.

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,280
足球队的! 快过来!
Let's go, team! Come on!

276
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,870
都过来! 集合了!
Gather round! Bring it in!

277
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,130
听着 明天是我们的第一场比赛
Listen, tomorrow is our first game, okay?

278
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,020
如果我们参加了就要全力以赴
And if we go out there and we do the best we can

279
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,990
享受比赛 我想我们能赢!
and we have some fun, I think we can win!

280
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,180
不不不不不
No, no, no, no, no.

281
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,390
我们本能赢 但是我们赢不了
We can win, but we won't.

282
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,920
为什么赢不了呢?
And why not?

283
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,310
因为我们有短板
Because there is a weak link among us.

284
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,470
说的就是你 迪克・布特克斯
It's you, Dick Butkus.

285
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,540
你的弱势太明显了很难弥补
Your weaknesses are simply too strong to overcome.

286
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,990
- 所以你得离队 - 什么?
- And therefore you are off the team. - What?

287
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,110
你对我能力的评价直率但准确
Your assessment of my abilities is blunt but precise.

288
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,390
我愿意离队
I shall take my leave.

289
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,470
你不能把他踢出队伍
You can't kick him off the team.

290
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,950
可他是最弱的一个
Oh, well, he's the weakest,

291
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,870
我必须坚决果断绝不手软
and I must be fierce and take no prisoners.

292
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,670
这样能促使他更加努力
It will motivate him to work harder.

293
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,180
好吧 但我才是教练 我说了让他留下
Okay, well, I'm the coach, and I say that he stays.

294
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,510
好吧 那你也离队 马蒂
Fine. You're off the team, Marty.

295
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,780
你不能踢我走! 我是教练!
You can't kick me off! I'm the coach!

296
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,270
全队听着 投票表决
Team, loyalty vote.

297
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,580
你们是愿意跟随我走向胜利
Would you rather follow me to victory

298
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,920
还是愿意跟着韦弗教练走向失败?
or coach Weaver to certain defeat?

299
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,310
现在就选
Choose now!

300
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,430
马克斯?
Max?

301
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,920
好啦 爸爸! 瞧瞧她这短裤!
Come on, dad! Look at her in those shorts!

302
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,740
我可不是小孩子了
I just got puberty.

303
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,020
是啊
Yeah.

304
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,540
往好地方想想 教练
Look on the bright side, coach.

305
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,890
你穿短裤也挺好看的
You also look good in your shorts.

306
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
看见没?
See?

307
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,840
积极强化并不奏效
Positive reinforcement doesn't really work.

308
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,900
训练得如何?
How was practice?

309
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,980
杰西让我泪流满面
Jackie made me cry.

310
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,470
因为她让我觉得我有多棒...
Because she made me feel so good about myself...

311
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,460
我也确实感觉很好
Which I do. I feel really good about me.

312
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,760
你懂的 我做了这么有意义的事儿
You know, 'cause I'm making such a difference, you know?

313
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,770
你呢? 点心义卖办得如何?
What about you? How's the bake sale coming?

314
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,060
非常好 棒极了 也是意义非凡
Awesome. Excellent. Also making a difference.

315
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,360
有拉里・伯德帮忙 整个家教会都听我的
With Larry Bird, the P.T.A. is all mine.

316
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,070
绝无异议
Literally.

317
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,230
挺好
Yeah.

318
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,460
好吧 那我去洗个澡
All right, well, I'm gonna go take a shower.

319
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,650
我要去烤饼干了
I'm gonna go bake the cookies.

320
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,910
我自我感觉真挺好
But I feel really good about myself

321
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,980
因为确实做了有意义的事儿
'cause I'm making a difference.

322
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,650
我就更别提了
Well, I'm even gladder

323
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,220
我做的就更有意义了 所以...
that I'm making more of a difference, so...

324
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,480
杰西说我大腿说得没错
Jackie was right about my thighs.

325
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,210
帮我们做饼干的帮手呢?
Where are the minions to make our cookies?

326
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,870
我鼓舞士气来了
I'm here to motivate their labor.

327
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,520
没有帮手 拉里 一个也没有
The minions quit, Larry. Every single one of 'em.

328
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,180
他们都觉得你是个危险的疯子
They all think you're a dangerous lunatic,

329
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,590
而且我同意他们 
and I agree with them.

330
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,260
鼠目寸光的傻子
Oh! Short-sighted fools.

331
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,620
他们显然是不配让你来领导的
They're obviously not worthy of your leadership.

332
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,670
没有他们你会做得更棒的
You're better off without them.

333
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,390
我不同意 您没看到
Well, I would disagree, since now you and I...

334
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,800
咱俩得做两百个姜饼
have to make 200 gingerbread cookies

335
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,150
而且明早前就得做好
by tomorrow morning by ourselves.

336
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,740
啥?
What?

337
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,560
不 我做不来
Oh, no, I can't.

338
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,860
我有点工作上的事儿
I have a, um, a work thing which I have to att...

339
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,670
- 你没有 - 我没有
- No, you don't. - No, I don't.

340
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,280
- 我家猫猫刚死 - 坐下
- My cat just died. - Sit.

341
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,000
咱们动手做吧
Let's get cooking.

342
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,720
嘿 迪克 干嘛呢?
Hey, Dick, what are you doing?

343
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,700
我在练习 这样我就有机会归队了
I'm practicing so that I might return to the team

344
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,060
我妈也会对我另眼相看
and regain my mother's respect.

345
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,270
但目前看来 完全没戏
So far, it's been a total disaster.

346
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,280
其实有时候是父母太把体育当回事了
Well, you know, sometimes parents take sports a little too seriously.

347
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,200
事实上我觉得
And the truth is, I think this might be

348
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,870
这件事的问题在于你妈 不是你
more about your mom than you.

349
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,030
但不可否认的是
But you must admit, by all metrics,

350
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,820
我的体育真的太弱了
I am a pretty bad athlete.

351
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,640
弱爆了 但这不意味着
Oh, the worst. But that doesn't mean

352
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,400
你妈没有为你而骄傲
that your mother isn't proud of you.

353
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,350
我感觉她在你这么大的时候和你一样
I think you're a lot like she was at this age,

354
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,190
体育真的帮她建立了自信
and sports really helped her with her self-esteem.

355
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,480
她希望你也可以这样
And she just wants that same thing for you.

356
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,430
但我又不缺自信
But I'm not lacking self-esteem.

357
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,750
我为啥要没自信? 你看
Why would I be? I mean, look at me.

358
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,210
谁人能有这等姿色?
Who else do you think could pull off this look?

359
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,420
还真不是一般人
Wow, not many.

360
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,390
你是个好孩子 迪克・布特克斯
You're a good kid, Dick Butkus.

361
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,140
快去穿上队服
Why don't you go get your uniform on?

362
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,100
让你归队啦
We're gonna go get you back on that team.

363
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,800
二 四 六 八!
Two, four, six, eight!

364
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,850
二 四 六 八! 二 四 六 八!
Two, four, six, eight! Two, four, six, eight!

365
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,530
迪克?
Dick?

366
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,050
不惜任何代价取得胜利
Win at all costs.

367
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,490
坚决果断 绝不手软
Be fierce. Take no prisoners.

368
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,400
我一点儿都不想我儿子
I don't miss my son at all.

369
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,280
姜饼人!
Gingerbread cookies!

370
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
点心义卖 美味小姜饼

371
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,830
帮助球队买新队服
Help the soccer team buy new uniforms.

372
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,410
很好吃哦
They're yummy.

373
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,680
吃起来比看起来美味
They can't taste worse than they look.

374
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,800
不管怎么说我觉得我们还是赢了的
You know, in spite of everything, I think this was quite a victory.

375
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,850
真的? 你这么觉得 拉里?
Do you? Do you, Larry?

376
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,080
我们一块饼干都没卖出去
We've sold zero cookies.

377
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,130
所有家长们都和我们保持距离
Alienated the parents of all our kids' friends,

378
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,220
把一个女人搞疯了
drove a woman crazy,

379
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,610
还做了人类史上
and made the worst gingerbread cookies

380
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,070
最难吃的姜饼
in the history of mankind.

381
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,360
哪来的胜利 拉里?
So, why? Why, Larry?

382
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,660
因为我本来觉得在艺术项目和老师评估方面
Well, because I actually thought you had some pretty good ideas

383
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,940
你是很有想法的
about arts programs and teacher evaluation.

384
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,360
如果有人问我 我会否认 但是
And if anyone ever asks, I shall deny it, but...

385
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,550
如果我需要一个人类女士
If I had to have a human woman

386
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,070
来指导我孩子的教育
guiding my children's education,

387
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,940
我会非常希望是你 黛比・韦弗
I'd be very happy if it were you, Debbie Weaver.

388
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,220
你是个好女人
You are a good human woman.

389
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,958
拉里 你的话让我感动死了
That is actually a very sweet thing to say, Larry.

390
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,540
- 别这么怪怪的 - 不 你才怪
- Please don't be weird. - No, you're weird.

391
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,940
- 好吧 是挺怪的 - 是的
- Okay, well, this is weird. - It is.

392
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,610
上 上!
Go, go!

393
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,900
你好 教练妈妈
Hello, coach mother.

394
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,390
你好 儿子
Hello, son.

395
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,810
马蒂 你来我的球场干啥
Marty, what are you doing on my field?

396
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,810
你得让迪克归队
You need to put Dick in the game.

397
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,970
不 不行
No, I can't.

398
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,450
别这样 杰西 他又不是你
Oh, come on, Jackie. This isn't you.

399
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,800
我知道你担心迪克的自尊心受挫
I know you're worried about Dick's self-esteem,

400
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,530
但没必要 迪克很强大的
but you don't have to be. Dick is a great kid!

401
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,080
瞧瞧他 聪明 有同情心
Look at him. He's smart, he's compassionate.

402
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,180
还很可爱
Huh? He's cute.

403
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,240
等我学会了敲防弹门的笑话
And once I learn a couple of bulletproof "knock-knock" jokes,

404
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,570
- 我就天下无敌了 - 瞧见没?
- I'll be the total package. - You see that?

405
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,330
我就没见过哪个大人有他这么自信
I mean, I don't know an adult who's that confident.

406
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,130
我就是担心
I just worry.

407
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,410
孩子们总是对那些特殊的孩子很残酷
Kids can be so cruel to unique children.

408
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,570
虽然你很不一般
Although you are really quite remarkable.

409
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,830
好吧
Okay.

410
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,330
加油 伙计 穿上
Here you go, buddy. Put these on.

411
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,490
你是个好教练 马蒂・韦弗
You are a good coach, Marty Weaver.

412
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,820
- 还好啦 - 嗯
- I'm okay. - Mm.

413
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,550
漂亮 迪克!
Nice try, Dick!

414
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,900
不是吧
No, it wasn't.

415
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,390
拉里・伯德! 能说点鼓励的话吗!
Larry Bird! Say something encouraging!

416
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,440
- 好吧 - 我是认真的
- Fine. - Honestly.

417
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,130
- 头发很飘逸啊 儿啊 - 是的呢!
- Your hair looks great, son! - Yes!

418
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,430
从你这遗传的 
He gets that from you.

419
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,140
谢谢 是从我这遗传的
 - Thank you. Yes, he does.

420
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,320
- 神啊 他太糟了 - 我知道
- Oh, God, he's terrible. - I know.

421
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,520
嘿
Hey.

422
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,720
我能买块饼干么?
Can I buy a cookie?

423
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,540
别了吧 除非你想品尝失败的滋味
I wouldn't. Unless you like the taste of failure.

424
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,150
所以说我们该一起干活的
You know, this is why we should do this stuff together,

425
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,850
因为我觉着我们配合的不错的
because I think we make a pretty good team.

426
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,130
不是吧 我们配合是超好的
Oh, come on. We make a great team.

427
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,880
有人说我是很棒的教练
You know, I've been told that I'm a fantastic coach.

428
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,730
有人说我是个好女人
Well, I've been told that I'm a pretty good human woman, so...

429
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,120
你怎么办到的? 
How did you do it?

430
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,500
嗨 琳达 什么怎么办到?
Hi, Linda. Do what?

431
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,290
姜饼人 它是活的!
The gingerbread man... it was alive!

432
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,730
我不知道是怎么办到的 但它是活的
I don't know how, but it was alive.

433
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,470
我觉得就是突然然间发生太多事 你没适应好
You know, I think you're just stressed out from the drama of everything.

434
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,950
根本没有活的姜饼人 琳达
There's no such thing as a living gingerbread man, Linda.

435
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,870
真的?
Oh. Really?

436
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,340
把球捡回来 迪克!
Get the ball, Dick!

437
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,130
我跑的够快了!
