1
00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:07,667
伙计们 你们绝对想不到刚刚出什么事了
You guys. You guys will not believe what just happened.

2
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:09,016
我来这的路上
On my way here,

3
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:11,318
一辆出租车开上了路边 压住了一个老太太
a taxi jumped the curb and it pinned this old lady,

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,687
然后我打了鸡血一样的冲了过去
and I-I just went into this, like, crazy adrenaline mode

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:15,239
我把那个老太救了出来
and I somehow lifted it off her.

6
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,857
噢 老天 泰德 你的手腕
Oh, my God, Ted, your wrist.

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,475
哦 是 我觉得就是有点浮肿
Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little swollen.

8
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,244
应该是抬那出租车的时候弄伤了
I must've strained it lifting.

9
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:21,829
我觉得我亲爱的朋友莉莉说的是
I believe our dear friend Lily was referring

10
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:23,030
你的另外一个手腕
to your other wrist.

11
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:25,082
戴着男士避孕环的那个
The one wearing the male birth control.

12
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:26,350
我认为那是一个
I was gonna go with

13
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:27,418
贞操手镯
"Chastity bracelet."

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,820
天啊 我还能再多爱你一点吗
God, is it possible to love you more?

15
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,255
有没有搞错啊
Really? Really?

16
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:33,340
我刚刚救了一条人命 你们两个就只注意这个
I just saved someone's life, and you guys are focusing on this?

17
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:35,042
对 伙计们 别管他
Yeah, you know what, guys? Leave him alone.

18
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:36,210
他是个英雄
All right, he's a hero.

19
00:00:36,212 --> 00:00:37,344
谢谢
Thank you.

20
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,830
你不觉得你的超能力来自于
Do you think that your super strength came from

21
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,382
女超人的魔法护腕吗
wearing Wonder Woman's magic wrist cuff?

22
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:45,168
对 我要让你们知道因为这个护腕
Yeah, I'll have you know that because of this cuff,

23
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,637
今天佳人有约
I have a date.

24
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:47,888
靠护手霜和约炮神器吗
With some hand lotion and the Internet?

25
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,307
我确实还能再多爱你一点
It is possible to love you more!

26
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,010
她是真实存在的
She exists.

27
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,479
她就在外面
And she's right outside.

28
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:56,363
很好 带她进来
Great. Bring her in.

29
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:57,731
不觉得吗 今日天气甚好
You know what? It's so nice out.

30
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:59,733
不如我们出去散散步吧
Why don't... why don't we just all go for a walk.

31
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,785
外面瓢泼大雨 泰德 我觉得很明显
It's pouring rain, Ted. I think it's pretty obvious

32
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:03,404
她是太胖了进不来
she can't fit through the door. Mm.

33
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:05,472
她是个极好的 运动型的女人
She is a gorgeous, athletic woman.

34
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,908
运动型 其实就是平胸
"Athletic"? Sideburns, no cans.

35
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,093
她超火辣的
She is hot.

36
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:11,028
那她为啥就不能进来呢 泰德
So why can't she come in, Ted?

37
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,914
她可以进来
She can come in.

38
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,250
六个半月以后
In six and a half months.

39
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:18,202
等一下 你是说她
Wait. Are you saying she's...

40
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:19,236
20岁
Twenty.

41
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:20,337
半
And a half.

42
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:21,538

46
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,274
等等 伙计们
Ah-ah! Hold up, guys.

47
00:01:40,276 --> 00:01:43,610
她得走了 一个快闪突然出现在了威廉斯堡
She had to bounce. Um, a flash mob broke out in front

48
00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:46,363
的一个棒子墨西哥餐车的前面
of a line of Korean-Mexican food trucks in Williamsburg.

49
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:47,397
唯一能让她
The only thing

50
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,016
快速超过20岁的方法
that would make her more of a 20-year-old

冷笑话一则 怎样快速到21岁 答 滑过去

52
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:50,617
是一种交通工具
is an ironic form

53
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:51,669
-这冷爆了  -耶
-of transportation. -Yeah.

54
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:52,853
她是滑轮滑过去的
She's roller skating there.

55
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,456
我不知道哪一个更可悲了
I don't know which is more pathetic--

56
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,458
是你跟一个20岁的人约会
that you're going out with a 20-year-old

57
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,377
还是你为了跟她约会买了一个皮革护腕
or that you bought a leather cuff to get a date with her.

58
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,745
我才不是买这个
I didn't buy this

59
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:02,930
就是为了约会
to get a date.

60
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:04,548
我只是偶然出去
I just happened to be out

61
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,916
赶上了某个周六下午的
catching up on some Saturday afternoon

62
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,250
皮革护腕的展销会
leather cuff shopping, Oh.

63
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,220
然后她碰巧就在那卖护腕
and she just happened to be a leather cuff saleswoman.

64
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:14,475
天啊 我很高兴我不在外面追女人了
God, I am so glad I am done chasing bimbos.

65
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:16,927
我现在订婚了 那些追女人的日子
Now that I'm engaged, that whole part of my life

66
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,529
真是悲哀又空虚
just seems sad and empty.

67
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:19,596
不是我说的难听
I don't want this to sound

68
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,899
泰德 你让我恶心
too harsh, Ted, but you disgust me.

69
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:25,536
一个月前你的床头柜上还有台自动润滑油售货机
Until a month ago, your headboard had a lube dispenser.

70
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:26,820
呃 对
Uh, yeah.

71
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:29,239
-我们不再那样了 好吧  -对
-We got rid of that, okay? -Yeah.

72
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,491
总之 说到订婚
Anyway, speaking of engaged,

73
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:32,659
看看这个改过尺寸拿回来的东西
check out what got back from being resized.

74
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:35,829
哦 天啊 看看这钻石有多大
Oh, my God. Look at the size of that rock.

75
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:37,164
巴尼 你没有
Barney, you don't

76
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,449
用那个"捉奸之钻"
start with the I-got-caught-cheating diamond.

77
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,451
你成熟了
You give yourself room to grow.

78
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,452
这是个传家宝
It's a family heirloom.

79
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,954
对 圣诞节时 
Yeah, I got a few dirty looks

80
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,422
我被巴尼同父异母的妹妹小小的鄙视了一下
from Barney's half-sister over Christmas,

81
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:48,258
所以我必须坐下来很尊重的跟她解释
so I had to sit her down and explain very respectfully...

82
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,343
让她滚犊子了
that she can suck it.

83
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:50,293
好吧
Okay.

84
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,294
我得走了
I got to bounce.

85
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,179
别再那么说了
Stop saying that.

86
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:53,981
这个迪拜来的DJ
This DJ from Dubai is spinning

87
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:55,833
在布什维克的一个废弃的码头打转
at an abandoned loading dock in Bushwick.

88
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,484
我怕我穿的太少了
I'm worried I don't have enough layers.

89
00:02:57,486 --> 00:02:59,119
如果我朋友们
So what if my friends

90
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:00,487
觉得这是注定的呢
thought it was doomed?

91
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,639
我还年轻 我知道那晚跟一个
I was still young, and I knew that a night of partying

92
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,324
比我小十几岁的女孩参加聚会
with a girl over a decade younger than me

93
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,692
会是完全的
would be a total...

94
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:08,495
灾难 她就像是完全不同的物种
...disaster. She's like an entirely different species.

95
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:11,949
我确实是穿的太少了
And I definitely didn't have enough layers.

96
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:14,451
她说的话有一半我都听不懂
I didn't understand half the words she was saying.

97
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:18,038
对我来说 那听起来就像是流行的疯狂填词
To me, it all sounded like hipster Mad Libs.

98
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,456
你看手机了没
Didn't you check your phone?

99
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,508
o
I just "Means of contacting" You

100
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:27,097
此乃90后美少女火星文

101
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,761
鲭ㄋ
on "Currently hot social networking site."

102
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:24,711
m^l
The show's been moved

103
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:25,796
搬KH
to "New York neighborhood

104
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:27,097
oi
you've never heard of."

105
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:31,852
哦 哇 我手机上还有表呢
Oh. Wow, my phone has a clock.

106
00:03:31,854 --> 00:03:35,305
而且他们赖以生存的饮食上一堆毫无意义的奇怪组合
And they subsist on a diet of pointlessly weird combinations.

107
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:36,356
哦
Ooh.

108
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,142
嘿 你想和我一起吃一个拌菜味
Hey, do you want to split a kimchi cupcake

109
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:39,309
上面撒上培根霜的蛋糕吗
with bacon frosting?

110
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,694
这里做的最好吃了
They are the best here.

111
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:42,362
哦 好啊 那种食物和我这个
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that'll go great with my

112
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:44,314
黄瓜小辣椒鸡蛋汁很搭
cucumber jalape?o egg cream.

113
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,482
赶紧都喝了 走吧 走吧
Chug it! Come on. Come on.

114
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:47,117
-我们该走了  -好吧
-We got to get going. -Right. Okay.

115
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:52,522
晚些时候 一个坐落在在中国城的
Then later, at a club in Chinatown

116
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,875
不知道在什么地方的下水井盖下面的俱乐部里
somehow located beneath a manhole cover,

117
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:55,993
事情就变得很诡异了
it got weird.

118
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,294
天 我真的好喜欢你
God, I just love those

119
00:03:57,296 --> 00:03:59,797
眉毛里那些灰色的小毛毛
tiny gray hairs in your eyebrows.

120
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,699
老人真的好性感
Old men are so sexy.

121
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,452
好吧 是这样的
All right, to be fair,

122
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,138
一些灰色的眉毛是鸡蛋汁干了造成的
some of those gray hairs were dried egg cream.

123
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,507
原因是 当你滑旱冰滑到吐的时候
Turns out, when you projectile vomit on skates,

124
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:11,758
你会直接摔在你吐的那一摊东西上
you roll right into the spray.

125
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,311
等等 她觉得你多大啊
Wait, how old does she think you are?

126
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:16,046
你参加过越南战争吗
So, were you in Vietnam?

127
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,632
先别叫 我还没说完呢
Hold that groan.

128
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:22,820
越共漫山遍野
Charlie was everywhere.

129
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:24,738
她超辣的 她就喜欢老人
She's hot! She likes old guys!

130
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,906
别来批评我
Don't judge me!

131
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:29,076
然后我们走进舞厅
Anyway, when we got out on the dance floor, th...

132
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:31,695
我发誓 那些二十岁的小年轻看起来都像...
I swear, this is what all the 20-year-olds looked like...

133
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:39,402
列兵 感谢您为国效力 国家和人民是不会忘记你的 
I want to thank you for your service to this nation, Private.

134
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,737
是上校好不
Colonel.

135
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:43,040
我该把这事了结了
I got to end this.

136
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,508
是啊 真的 泰德
Yeah, seriously, Ted.

137
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,127
为了一夜春宵假装成别人
Pretending to be someone else just to get laid?

138
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,012
可真丢人
That's... embarrassing.

139
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:50,130
参见殿下
Your Highness!

140
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:52,349
我们快走吧
Let's go.

141
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:54,918
哦 马修 把那东西摘下来
Ew. Marshall, take that off.

142
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,221
怎么啦 我觉得这东西很酷啊
What? I think it looks kind of cool.

143
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:58,555
很酷
Cool?

144
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:01,475
你看起来就像很怂的乐队里的那些混混
You look like one of those jerks who's in some lame band

145
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:05,529
骑摩托不戴头盔子 钱包上拴个小链子
and rides a motorcycle without a helmet and has a wallet chain

146
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:07,898
纹身纹了满脖子 没事儿吸个小毒子
and neck tattoos and a drug problem.

147
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,533
不是...一个大的...就是...
Not a... A big one, just, uh...

148
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:13,237
在路边跟他开个价 磨叽一会儿
enough that he deals a little bit on the side, and...

149
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:16,740
然后他永远都不会真诚对待女人的那种
he can never... ever be true to one woman.

150
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,775
赶紧吃掉那个切糕 干我吧
Finish that damn pickle and do me!

151
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:25,382
好吧 你们知道我的早晨一般都怎么过吗
Okay, you guys know how my mornings usually go.

152
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:26,750
我们为啥要知道
Why would we care how...

153
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:27,968
一般情况下都是这样度过的
Usually it's like this.

154
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:31,288
你先来
After you.

155
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,723
哦 谢谢
Aw, thank you.

156
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,263
免费的 罗宾
On the house, Robin!

157
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:42,900
面包圈给你免费滴
Take this bagel on the house

158
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:45,102
报纸送你免费滴
Have a paper on the house

159
00:05:45,104 --> 00:05:46,937
这栋房子都免费送你
I'd give you a house on the house

160
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:49,523
如果我真的可以
If I could

161
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,474
你就是如此美丽
You're so beautiful

162
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,195
每天都该免费拿东西
Everything in life should be free

163
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:59,866
做人做到我这份上是多惬意
It's so wonderful to be me!

164
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:02,536
哇哦
Wow.

165
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:05,923
是不是每天早上都有小蓝鸟帮你穿衣服呢
Do little bluebirds help you get dressed in the morning, too?

166
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,208
她只不过是夸张一点来
She's exaggerating

167
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:14,298
举个例子而已
To make a point!

168
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,433
但是今天就不一样了
But today was different.

169
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,269
一共3块7毛5
That'll be $3.75.

170
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:21,438
但我昨天并没交钱啊
But I didn't have to pay yesterday.

171
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,106
好的 那就7块5
Okay. $7.50.

172
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,693
-哦 我的小可怜啊  -都是因为戒指 罗宾
-Oh, honey-sweetie-baby. -It's the ring, Robin.

173
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:28,178
戒指是有能量的
The ring has power.

174
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,013
当一个女人戴上订婚戒指
When a woman puts on an engagement ring,

175
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,149
它就像指环王里面的比尔博・巴金斯
it's like when Bilbo Baggins wears the One Ring

176
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:33,233
戴着至尊魔戒一样
in The Hobbit.

177
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:35,018
好吧 你能重新说一遍 但是稍微不那么像死宅吗
Okay, can you say that again but not in nerd?

178
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,687
好的 戒指就像斗篷
Sure. Uh, the ring is like the cloak

179
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,040
和哈利波特穿着到处乱跑的那件斗篷效果一样
that Harry Potter wears to sneak around Hogwarts.

180
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:41,491
好吧 我也不说处男语
Yeah, I don't speak virgin either.

181
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:44,127
那戒指 让你隐形
The ring-- it makes you invisible.

182
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:49,800
你不是宝贝
You're not precious.

183
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:49,800
模仿魔戒说的 "you are my precious"

184
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,177
哦 太好了 你还没睡
Oh, good, you're awake.

185
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:03,063
听着 泰德
Look, Ted,

186
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:04,765
有些事情我们要谈一谈
there's something we have to talk about.

187
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:07,150
朋友之间的尺度 侵犯隐私
Boundaries? Invasion of privacy?

188
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:09,186
剥夺你的钥匙权
Losing your key privileges?

189
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:11,571
是关于那个20岁的女孩的 泰德
It's about the 20-year-old, Ted.

190
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:13,556
你必须得把她上了
You have to bang her.

191
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,025
为了我
For me!

192
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,033
为什么你想让我和一个20多岁的女孩勾搭在一起
Why do you want me to hook up with this 20-year-old?

193
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:22,516
我以为这么做让你恶心了
I thought I disgusted you.

194
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:24,185
是啊 那全都是装的
Yeah, that was all an act.

195
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:26,437
你看 那个 我爱罗宾
Look, look, look, I love Robin

196
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,806
她是我唯一想跟着一起生活的女人
and she's the only girl I want to be with.

197
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:32,810
但我的身体在四年内 经历的各种一夜情已让我中毒已深
But my body is detoxing after years of one-night stands.

198
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:33,794
他们又没为这种事情像戒烟戒酒一样
They don't make

199
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:36,313
弄个口香糖或者贴个贴什么的
gum or a patch for this, Ted.

200
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:38,199
但是 嘿 又一个金点子哦
But, hey, billion-dollar idea alert.

201
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,701
对 就写这里了
Oh, yeah here here.

202
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:42,870
好吧 我还是买本新的梦境日志好了
That's okay. I'll just buy a new dream journal.

203
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:47,291
你现在想找什么
What-what-what are you looking for?

204
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,259
你的电话
Your phone.

205
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:50,427
里面一定有她的图片什么的
There's got to be some pictures of her in here.

206
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,129
我去 不是吧
Damn it. No.

207
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,581
这些都毫无价值啊
Those are all worthless.

208
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,999
我需要些一夜情的素材啊 泰德亲
I need some one-night-stand material, Ted.

209
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,269
啊 这张是你麻麻的照片 你好啊 维吉尼亚
Oh. Oh. Here's your mom. Hello, Virginia.

210
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:01,272
呃 我妈可不是一夜情的素材
Um, my mother is not one-night-stand material.

211
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,808
对 你说的没错 那不是夜里 而且咱们也没有"情"
Yeah, you're right. It wasn't night and we weren't standing.

212
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,175
哈哈
Hey-oh!

213
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:06,560
那不可能发生过
That didn't happen.

214
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,979
没错 是没发生过
You're right. It didn't.

215
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:09,897
你刚刚眨眼了
You just winked.

216
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,198
才没有呢
No, I didn't.

217
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,199
你又来了
You just did it again!

218
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,852
听好了 总之 我需要你
Look, bottom line: I need you

219
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:16,787
代替我把那妹子睡了
to proxy bang this girl for me.

220
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:17,955
做我的替身
Be my stand-in

221
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:20,040
用你的身体压之
and put your gland in.

222
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,076
对了 这句话印在帽子上感觉不错
Hey, wow, that'd be good on a hat.

223
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:23,577
巴尼
Barney,

224
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:26,747
她只是看中我这朵优雅的风中残烛罢了
she's just using me for my gracefully aging body.

225
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:29,366
你现在知道为了面子得挑点靠谱的人选啦
You're picking now to get some self-respect?

226
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:33,304
你之前在把一个盲妹子的时候 还把自己装成肖恩?康纳利
You once banged a blind girl by pretending to be Sean Connery.

227
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:33,304
第一代詹姆斯?邦德

228
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,505
那是你好伐
That was you.

229
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:37,975
是的 那是我平生最愉悦的任务
Yeah, that conquest was most enjoyable.

230
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:37,975
模仿邦德说话

231
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:39,727
抱歉 要我拿下那妹子
I'm sorry. T-To hook up with a girl,

232
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,045
我得找到共鸣 哪怕只有一点也行啊
I have to connect with her at least a little.

233
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:44,148
那就共鸣去啊
Then find a connection.

234
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,399
搞简单点
Just go simple.

235
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,485
别扯那些怪怪的诗词建筑
Nothing about weird poets or buildings

236
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,221
或者你曾经发给我的那些题为
or any of those stupid articles you've ever e-mailed me

237
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:53,724
题为 心灵鸡汤 的二逼小文章
with the subject line "Food for thought."

238
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:56,360
求你了 泰德
Please, Ted.

239
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:57,995
我要嘛
I need this.

240
00:08:57,997 --> 00:08:59,663
败给你了
Fine. You win.

241
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,032
我这就去搞定一个二十岁辣妹
I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.

242
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:03,901
但我不会觉得愉悦
But I'm not gonna enjoy...

243
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:04,902
别欺骗自己了
Oh, who am I kidding?

244
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,086
那肯定爽爆了好吧
It's gonna be awesome.

245
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,256
现在 关上灯 然后走你
Now, turn off the lights and go.

246
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,459
留个小灯
Not all the way!

247
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,513
哈 三瓶...
Hello. Yeah, three...

248
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,999
以往纽约是全世界最友好
Okay, normally New York is the friendliest,

249
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:21,135
最便宜的城市了有木有
most affordable city in the world.

250
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:24,371
现在这儿就跟旧金山一样又粗鲁又花钱
Now it's as rude and expensive as San Francisco.

251
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:26,390
伙计们
Guys?

252
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:28,309
嗯 这就是你订婚了以后的生活状态
Oh, hey, that's life once you're engaged.

253
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:31,362
告诉她 宝贝儿 让她心碎去吧
Oh, tell her, baby. Make it hurt.

254
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,564
咱们卡座见
I'll be at the booth.

255
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,482
我的小内内现在穿没穿 不一定
My panties may or may not be on

256
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:37,100
不过等到了卡座
when you get there.

257
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:39,153
那就一定脱掉了
They won't be!

258
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,072
你们两个发什么神经啊
Okay, what is going on with you guys?

259
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:43,324
是这腕带
It's the cuff.

260
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:45,876
总之把自己描绘成一个失意的音乐家
It turns out that picturing me as a loser musician

261
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,162
再加上对维柯丁上瘾并有一台小用来
with a Vicodin addiction and a beat-up van

262
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:52,166
偷铜线的小破车能让莉莉性致盎然
I use to steal copper wire really turns Lily's crank.

263
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:53,167
谁知道呢
Who knew?

264
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:54,919
哇 你的手腕怎么了
Whoa, what-what happened to your wrist?

265
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,955
呃 我对它过敏
Oh. It's an allergic reaction.

266
00:09:57,957 --> 00:09:59,340
那快点摘下来啊
So take it off.

267
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:01,291
罗宾 你若为人父母
Robin, once you have a child,

268
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:03,477

任何能够增加哪怕一点点上床概率的神器
anything that gets you even remotely close

269
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:06,847
都值得你去忍受一些充满脓水的脓包
to the possibility of sex is worth a few pus-filled blisters.

270
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:09,400
欢愉会压过苦楚的
Better the sores weep than I.

271
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:12,469
喂 等会儿 这贱货才到的这儿
Hey, hold on. That slut just got here.

272
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:14,571
她已经拿到啤酒了
How'd she get beer already?

273
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,624
你看到她手指头上有戒指没
Do you see a ring on that finger?

274
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,525
等会儿 脑子有点乱
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

275
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:20,160
你说的那些被无视什么的
Are you saying that this invisibility thing

276
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,196
意味着我连啤酒都拿不到
means I might not be able to get beer?

277
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,999
我才刚刚适应要自己付钱买咖啡
I was just getting used to the idea of having to pay for coffee

278
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,200
买面包圈交房租的事情
and bagels and rent.

279
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:28,291
-连房租都  -但我连啤酒都喝不到
-Rent?  -But not being able to get a beer?

280
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:29,753
叔可忍 姐不能忍
Unacceptable.

281
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,874
打扰一下
Excuse me.

282
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:35,793
辣妹求插队
Hot girl coming through.

283
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,355
三瓶啤酒 谢了
Three beers, please.

284
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:55,479
我了个大擦的戒指
Damn it, ring!

285
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:59,616
等会你得去买一副小弹簧刀
Later you should totally go out and buy a switchblade.

286
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:00,951
妥妥的
Mm. Sure.

287
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,854
我不在那会儿 爹地也要会去买点尿布啦
While I'm out, maybe Daddy picks up some diapers

288
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:07,074
微辣莎莎酱什么的 毕竟我们库存不够了嘛
and a little mild salsa because we're low.

289
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:11,829
好吧 你们是对的
Well, you're right

290
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:14,665
我成六娃了
I'm invisible.

291
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:19,365
科普 六娃是中国传统动漫"福禄娃"中的隐形娃

292
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:21,738
那晚 唯一一个
That night, the only person

293
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,125
比罗宾还挫败的人是她的未婚夫
in worse shape than Robin was her fiance.

294
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:26,960
泰德 我绝望了
Ted, I'm desperate.

295
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:28,962
今天早些时候 我看到那腕带了
Earlier today, I saw that wrist cuff

296
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:31,014
然后向他默哀了
and I got a partial for Marshall.

297
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:32,682
你到底把没把到那个妹子啊
Did you bang that girl yet?

298
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:34,718
别报那么大希望 也别有任何想法
Don't get your hopes, or anything else, up.

299
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,352
我试着找与她的共鸣
I tried to connect with her,

300
00:11:36,354 --> 00:11:38,254
可我说的所有话都回到
but everything just comes back

301
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:40,557
她喜欢老男人这种奇怪癖好
to her weird fetish about how old I am.

302
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,926
好吧 就说点简单的 她喜欢看电视吗
Well, j-just go simple-- does she like TV?

303
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:44,944
不喜欢
No.

304
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:47,030
但我愿意和你一起看《新闻60分》
But I'll watch 60 Minutes with you

305
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:50,200
想看多久 开多大声音 都行
as loud and as long as you want.

306
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:51,234
喜欢体育吗
Sports?

307
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:52,485
不喜欢
No.

308
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:55,071
我敢肯定你打沙壶球一定超性感
But I bet you look super hot playing shuffleboard,

309
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:58,491
就是 涂满厚厚的止痛药膏的样子
just... slathered in Bengay.

310
00:11:58,493 --> 00:11:59,909
好吧 她爱读书吗
Well, does she like books?

311
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:01,444
不
No.

312
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,463
可我猜你一定爱读书
But I bet you do.

313
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:04,714
嗯
Mm-hmm.

314
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:06,800
我猜你一定有一副又大又厚实的
I bet you have a big, thick

315
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:09,002
近视老花镜
pair of bifocals.

316
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:12,088
她不是有恋父情结 而是有恋爷情结
She doesn't have daddy issues, she has granddaddy issues.

317
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,623
我不玩了
I'm ending it.

318
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,810
泰德 我求求你 永远不要停歇于 不停歇的娇体上
Ted, I beg of you, don't quit on a body that won't quit.

319
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:19,128
啊哦 这句话做成车贴一定好有爱
Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet on a bumper sticker.

320
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,346
得赶紧写到日志上
That's going in the journal.

321
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:23,066
等等 你是不是把我的梦境日志偷走了
Wait, did you steal my dream journal?

322
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:25,652
没有啊 在你牙齿掉光 光着屁股站在摇荡山庄高中
No! Now, get back in there before all your teeth fall out

323
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:25,652
泰德高中母校

324
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:27,854
参加一个你从来没彩排过的戏剧之前
and you're naked in front of Shaker Heights High School

325
00:12:27,856 --> 00:12:29,572
你赶紧给我滚过来
in a play you never rehearsed for.

326
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:30,973
魂淡
Bastard!

327
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:33,810
我们没有在任何一件事情上产生共鸣 都结束了
We don't connect on a single thing. It's over.

328
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:36,196
还没有
It's not...

329
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:37,831
你看 卡莉 我得跟你说
Look, Carly, I got to tell you something.

330
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,650
我就是 看不到未来
I just, I don't see a future here.

331
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:42,919
哦 我的天
Oh, my God.

332
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:45,121
你要死了吗
Are you dying?

333
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,124
这太性感了
Oh, that is so hot.

334
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,212
嘿
Hey...

335
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:53,847
那是R2-D2吗
is that R2-D2?

336
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:53,847
星战中的机器人之一

337
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:56,099
你喜欢星球大战吗
Do you like Star Wars?

338
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:58,000
我大爱星球大战
I love Star Wars.

339
00:12:58,002 --> 00:12:59,335
我也是
Me, too!

340
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:05,275
我其实只看过新的三部曲
I mean, I've only seen the new ones.

341
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:07,310
那也差不多啦
Close enough.

342
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:13,182
这么说
So?

343
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:14,067
嗯哪
Yeah.

344
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:15,785
我就知道 我都能感觉到
I knew it! I could feel it.

345
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:18,822
就好像我们俩一起上了她
It's almost like we were hooking up with her together.

346
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:20,073
你也感觉到了 是吧
You felt that, right?

347
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:21,624
如果我能感觉到 我就不举了
I couldn't have performed if I did.

348
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:22,992
你还不明白么 泰德
Don't you see, Ted?

349
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:25,662
咱们俩兄弟心有灵犀
We had a bro-nnection.

350
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:27,864
好了好了 赶紧给我看看
All right, I got to know

351
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:29,415
她长什么样子 给我看看照片
what she looks like-- show me a picture.

352
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,367
好吧 平时呢 我不屑于自拍艳照
Well, normally, I'm above such things,

353
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:34,504
但已经有一阵子了 而且 泰迪得秀一下
but it's been a while, and, uh, Teddy's braggin'.

354
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:36,205
好吧 这就是她
Okay, here she is.

355
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:39,342
好 往上看...
Okay. Scrolling up.

356
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:40,560
哦也 那就是
Oh, yeah, those are

357
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:42,545
所谓的"干我"牌高跟鞋 正点 
"Plow me" Heels. Nice.

358
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:46,065
膝盖上的淤青也挺带劲的
The knee bruise is encouraging.

359
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:49,385
继续往上 是一对20岁的波波
Working our way up to those 20-year-old ta-tas.

360
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:51,821
哦 可憎的地心引力还没有抓住你们
Oh... gravity's cruel grasp

361
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:54,891
我可爱的活泼的深造之物们
hasn't found you yet, my sweet perky miracles.

362
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:57,428
现在 让我们来一睹这浪女的真面容
Now, let's get a gander at Dirty Girl's face.

363
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:03,684
她的脸上就写着"准备被炮" 我没说错吧
Her face says, "Ready to bone," Am I right?

364
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,688
我再说一遍 我没说错吧
I say again, am I right?

365
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:11,352
那是我同父异母的妹妹
That's my half sister.

366
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,996
那你就不要翻看下一张照片了
Then you probably shouldn't scroll to the next picture.

367
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,984
不要
No!

368
00:14:25,277 --> 00:14:26,728
那是我的妹妹 泰德
That's my sister, Ted!

369
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:28,328
呃 我并不知道啊
Well, look, I didn't know!

370
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,129
两年前我们谁都不知道你有个妹妹
None of us even knew you had a sister

371
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:32,098
你当时也不知道
until two years ago, including you!

372
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,833
这肯定是个疯狂的巧合
This is just some crazy coincidence.

373
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:36,169
纽约市有400万女人
There are four million women in the city of New York,

374
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:37,670
泰德 你非得睡了我妹妹
Ted, and you sleep with my sister?

375
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:39,704
苍天为什么要这样对我啊
Why would the universe do that to me?

376
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:40,591
我不知道
I don't know.

377
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:42,675
就好像你没有这样对待过女人一样
It's not like you've ever treated women in such a way

378
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:44,227
这肯定是大自然冥冥之中给你的报应
that would invite some sort of karmic retribution.

379
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:46,545
你上了我的妹妹
You banged my sister!

380
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:49,399
我可爱的 娇俏的 纯洁的
My sweet, little, innocent...

381
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,867
-身上还打孔的 -真的吗 在哪儿
-Pierced. Really? -Where?

382
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,219
别告诉我 
Don't answer that!

383
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:56,406
现在我知道为什么我对昨晚感同身受了
Now I know why I felt everything you did to her last night.

384
00:14:56,458 --> 00:15:00,209
那不是是兄弟灵犀 是兄妹灵犀
It wasn't a bro-nnection, it was a sis-nnection!

385
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:01,494
喔 我的天 
Oh, my God.

386
00:15:01,496 --> 00:15:04,630
泰德 你有没有
Ted... did you...

387
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:09,535
爽飞了
Big-time.

388
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:10,819
牛逼 击掌
Nice! High five!

389
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:12,371
等等 不对 不对
Wait! No! No!

390
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:13,622
回收击掌
Retraction five!

391
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,877
喂 是你求着我代替你去上她的
Hey, hey, you're the one who begged for a proxy bang.

392
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,512
说到家人这方面
And while we're on the subject of family,

393
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:23,215
我敢肯定你上了我妈 这比妹妹更可忍
I'm pretty sure you banged my mom-- mom beats sister.

394
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:25,684
我从没有上过你妈
I never banged your mom.

395
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:27,502
你又给我眨眼了
You just did the winking thing again!

396
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:29,354
不 我才没
No, I didn't.

397
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:31,557
好吧 嘿 巴尼 我问你
Fine. Hey, Barney, let me ask you something.

398
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,559
你今天早上 是不是感到有点酸痛
Were you, uh, feeling a little sore this morning?

399
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:34,810
特别是在
Especially...

400
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:39,732
从此绝交
Friendship over!

401
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:42,985
哦耶
Oh, yeah.

402
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:48,157
谁是你又弹吉他又骑摩托又找不到调味酱
Who's your guitar-player-biker- who-couldn't-find-mild-salsa-

403
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,543
但是说管他呢而且开始进入状态的坏小子
but-said-screw-it- and-went-medium bad boy?

404
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:54,913
马修 你的手
Marshall, your hand!

405
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:56,949
好吧 我觉得没那么糟糕
Okay, I'm pretty sure it wasn't that bad,

406
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:59,701
但你们马修叔叔的版本就是这样子滴
but this is how Uncle Marshall likes to tell the story.

407
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:02,588
哦 是啊 不 就是因为这个护腕
Oh, yeah, no, that's the cuff.

408
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,707
我有点头晕 我都感觉不到手指了
I'm woozy, and I can't flex my fingers...

409
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:08,977
而且臭鱼的味道好像更强烈了
...and the rotten fish smell is getting stronger.

410
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:11,847
但我可以用我的左手来弥补下
But I'm learning to compensate with my left.

411
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:14,983
难道这就是为什么昨晚我让你"捏捏咪咪"
Is that why last night when I asked you to honka honka me

412
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:16,435
你只做到了"捏咪"
you only honka'd me?

413
00:16:16,437 --> 00:16:17,886
我以为你没注意到呢
I didn't think you noticed.

414
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:20,906
斯纳普可是嫉妒了喀拉寇整整一天
Snap's been jealous of Crackle all day.

415
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:20,906
马修给lily的lady parts起名字 snap crackle是两胸 详见S08E02

416
00:16:20,908 --> 00:16:22,825
你就把护腕摘掉吧
Just take the cuff off.

417
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:25,110
不 宝贝 这样咱就不能继续做了
No, but, baby, then all the sex will stop.

418
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:29,031
马修 你不需要用护腕来秀性感
Marshall, you don't need a cuff for me to find you sexy.

419
00:16:29,033 --> 00:16:30,532
你唯一需要做的
All you have to do

420
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:33,135
马修给lily的lady parts起名字 pop是除了两胸之外的那儿 
原谅女字幕菌无法直言其名 详见S08E02

421
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:33,135
就是一个微笑 而且我已经准备让你坐到波普上了
is smile, and I'm ready for you to hop on Pop.

422
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:35,587
谢谢你亲爱的
Thanks, baby.

423
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:38,907
在咱去看急诊之前
Are you too woozy to do it one last time

424
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,543
你还能顶着头晕做一次吗
before we seek emergency medical attention?

425
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:43,411
试一次才知道哦
Only one way to find out.

426
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:53,355
不好意思兄弟 我的反应实在是太过了
I'm sorry, bro, I totally overreacted.

427
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:54,590
你才发现吗
You think?

428
00:16:54,592 --> 00:16:57,192
真不敢相信你竟然送来一只死负鼠
I can't believe you're allowed to ship a dead possum.

429
00:16:57,194 --> 00:16:58,694
他死了
He died?

430
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:01,897
那只负鼠可是和平谈判的橄榄枝啊
That possum was supposed to be an olive branch.

431
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:05,317
你确定他不是在装死吗
Are you sure he's not just playing dead?

432
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,286
他闻起来像马修的手
He smells like Marshall's hand.

433
00:17:07,288 --> 00:17:09,238
等下 你原谅我了
And wait, you-you forgive me?

434
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,456
当然了 嘿 我这儿有两根"雪茄"
Absolutely. Hey, I got a couple "Cee-gars."

435
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:12,658
快过来
Get over here!

436
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,577
好了 你所谓的"雪茄"在哪
All right. So, where are those "Cee-gars"?

437
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,279
那玩意儿一会再亮出来
Eh, we'll break 'em out in a minute.

438
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:19,131
嘿 老巴
Hey, Barn.

439
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:21,667
泰德
Ted?

440
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:23,785
巴尼 你妹妹来这干嘛呢
Barney, what is your sister doing here?

441
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:25,787
没啥事哈 兄弟 或者该叫你
Nothing, bro. Or should I say,

442
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:27,973
妹夫
bro-in-law!

443
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,020
恭喜你啦
Congratulations!

444
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:44,773
你要娶我妹妹啦
You're marrying my sister!

445
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:47,776
看来你不惜一切代价呢 你个大傻帽
And you spared no expense, you big crazy!

446
00:17:50,496 --> 00:17:53,648
你们知道吗 虽然我深爱巴尼
You know what? I love Barney,

447
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,950
但戒指这玩意儿真烦人
but this ring thing sucks.

448
00:17:54,952 --> 00:17:57,169
有个猥琐男不小心蹭到了我的咪咪
Some gross guy just brushed up against my rack

449
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:58,620
他竟然道歉了
and then apologized.

450
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:01,039
而且是真心的道歉那种
And I think he really, really meant it.

451
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,426
哦 亲爱的 我知道被陌生人袭胸的感觉很美妙
Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice to be groped by strangers,

452
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:06,511
但是没有什么能比得上
but nothing beats the rush you get

453
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:08,997
那个特别的人眼里只有你的感觉
when that one special person looks at you.

454
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:10,465
她说的没错
It's true.

455
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:14,519
就像我坐在这儿 我的眼里只有一样东西
Like here in this bar, there's only one thing that I see,

456
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:16,723
就是我的小百合
and I see her brighter

457
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:20,559
比世间一切都明亮而清晰
and more clearly than anything else in this world.

458
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:22,527
你知道那是什么吗
You know what that is?

459
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:24,179
那就是爱
That's love.

460
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:25,981
也有可能是
And possibly

461
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:29,701
酒精混合了强效抗生素的效果
alcohol mixed with some very powerful antibiotics.

462
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,521
巴尼也是那样看你的
And that's how Barney sees you.

463
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:36,241
我还知道你看巴尼 也是如此
And I know that's how you see Barney.

464
00:18:37,727 --> 00:18:40,195
我想引用泰德的梦境日志
I'd like to start the service

465
00:18:40,197 --> 00:18:42,547
作为开场白
with a passage from Ted's dream journal.

466
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,050
像溺水时
"Drowning.

467
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:47,052
稀薄空气
"Gasping for air.

468
00:18:47,054 --> 00:18:49,204
无法逃离
No escape."

469
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:51,706
等下 那是说越南的吗
Wait, is that about Vietnam?

470
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,891
是说健康食品超市的
It's about Whole Foods.

471
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:53,992
巴尼
Barney.

472
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:55,877
我们俩不会结婚的
We are not getting married.

473
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:58,931
而且这个走廊也太窄了
And those aisles are too narrow!

474
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:02,017
但是你俩必须得结婚 否则
But you two have to get married-- otherwise, it's just

475
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,387
那只是一场毫无价值和意义的 令人作恶的一夜情
a cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stand.

476
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:08,156
等下 咱们得搞清楚 你刚才用
Wait, just to be clear, you're saying you're opposed

477
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:11,026
"毫无价值和意义 令人作恶"来形容一夜情
to cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stands?

478
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:12,060
对啊
Yes.

479
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:14,229
巴尼 你没看出来吗
Barney... don't you see?

480
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:16,231
你的瘾戒掉了
Your detox is done!

481
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,250
你已经不再执念于一夜情了
You're over one-night stands!

482
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:20,585
苍天啊 你说的太对了
Oh, my God, you're right!

483
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,287
我自由了
I'm free!

484
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:25,457
是啊 所以如果你能再考虑一下 就一小下
Yeah. So if you think about it-- but not too much--

485
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:28,126
我和卡莉搞一搞 其实挺好的 对吧
it's actually good that Carly and I hooked up.

486
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:30,095
对啊 是不错
Yeah, it's really good.

487
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:33,715
从功夫上看 好像他还是五十岁一样
I mean, this guy goes at it like he's still in his 50s.

488
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:36,134
嘿 来根雪茄 你个疯丫头
Hey, have a cigar, you big crazy!

489
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:38,971
喂 别以为这事儿就这么完了
Hey, don't try to make this okay.

490
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:40,555
你还睡着我妹妹呢
You still slept with my sister.

491
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:43,475
跟我保证 你永永远远也不再睡了
Promise me you will never, ever do that again.

492
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:46,261
我保证
I promise.

493
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:47,396
你刚才眨眼了
You just winked.

494
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:49,398
我没有啊
No, I didn't.

495
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,316
-你又眨了  -就是没有
-You did it again! -No, I didn't!

496
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:52,367
你发誓 行吗
You swear, right?

497
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:54,769
当然可以了
Yeah. Of course.

498
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:01,807
那天晚上
That night,

499
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:03,775
虽然罗宾还是买不到啤酒
even though she still couldn't get a beer,

500
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:07,195
但她感受到了来自戒指的真正能量
Robin realized the true power of the ring.

501
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:10,765
Drew Holcomb and The Neighbors - What Would I Do Without You

502
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,837
嘿 罗宾
Hey, Robin.

503
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:17,259
有没有想到你订婚后
Did you ever figure out how you're gonna get

504
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,177
怎么才能买到喝的
a drink at the bar now that you're engaged?

505
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:21,930
嗯 当然 我知道以后都要怎么做了
Oh, sure. I know a way that's gonna last forever.

506
00:20:21,932 --> 00:20:23,631
加冰威士忌
Scotch on the rocks?

507
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:24,766
马上就来
Coming right up.

508
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:33,992
在你们对这帽子发表评论之前
Now, before you say anything about the hat...

509
00:20:33,994 --> 00:20:37,645
我得说 这个新女孩有个完美的翘臀
this new girl's ass is phenomenal!

510
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:44,370
嘿 马修 来看看这个
Hey, Marshall, you got to see this.

511
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:46,595
他们肯定把我下的单登记错了
The catalog must have mixed up my order.

512
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:48,361
你绝对想不到这牛仔裤是什么样子
You won't believe the jeans they just sent me.

513
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:51,297
超级搞笑 是不
Hilarious, right?

514
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:53,833
是啊
Totally.

515
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:58,302
你看起来就像一位 开着装满过期麦圈和空饮料瓶
You look like some suburban mom who drives a minivan

516
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:01,537
小货卡的郊区母亲
filled with stale Cheerios and empty juice boxes...

517
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:06,289
有可能做辣肉酱通心粉和炸玉米派当晚餐
probably makes chili mac and Frito pie for dinner...

518
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,962
闻起来有种薄荷香烟的味道
smells like that menthol cigarette that she snuck while

519
00:21:09,062 --> 00:21:11,042
仿佛在等待 迎接他那练曲棍球的孩儿回家
she was waiting to pick her kids up from hockey practice.

520
00:21:11,142 --> 00:21:12,508
快给我过来
Get over here!

521
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,510
