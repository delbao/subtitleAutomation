Something happened. But bay won't say what.

Some of the deaf kids don't like the pilot program.

61
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:10,745

You'd think that people who had been bullied themselves

Do we know who she is?

Her name is lana.

You know her?

She came to the court looking for angelo,

91
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:12,728
×ÖÄ»
And both bay and daphne met her.

92
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:14,547

They just didn't know who she was.

93

When I found out.

00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,459
×ÖÄ»
But I knew what you would say.

98
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:25,787
×ÖÄ»
And it seemed as if you

99
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,766
×ÖÄ»
and angelo had finally buried the hatchet.

100
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:30,023

I know where I'd like to bury a hatchet.

Isn't your novela starting?

102

×ÖÄ»
Yes, but they're bound to be a letdown.

103
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:36,717
×ÖÄ»
Nothing they write in the telenovelas

104
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:39,408

Can hold a candle to angelo's real life.

105

I'm sorry, honey.

106

I'm not interested in memorizing talking points.

137
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:55,317

It's one of the things that drives me crazy

And john's great at speaking off-the-cuff.

×ÖÄ»
We've been getting very familiar with the issues.

143
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:09,100

I'd like to focus on education and immigration.

And you will.

×ÖÄ»
When you get elected.

146
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:13,737
×ÖÄ»
During the campaign, the trick is to keep it general.

147
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:15,999
×ÖÄ»
Pro-middle class, anti-big government.

148
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:16,853
×ÖÄ»
But I think what

149
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:18,562

Education and immigration

Talk about your business successes

156

If natalie wants to fight it out with graffiti,

She is the one who is throwing gasoline.

168
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:03,072
×ÖÄ»
And I've tried to make peace.

169
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:06,447
×ÖÄ»
And I'm trying to keep up, but she just keeps hating me

170
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:07,916
×ÖÄ»
Because I can hear.

171
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,537
×ÖÄ»
And that's like hating me

172
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,833
×ÖÄ»
Because I have brown hair or brown eyes.

173
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,598

There's nothing that I can do about it.

Wow, that sucks.

178
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:37,626
×ÖÄ»
But we didn't ask for any cuts.

179
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:40,231
×ÖÄ»
And if natalie and her posse

180
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:42,209
×ÖÄ»
Keep taking it out on the hearing kids,

181
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:43,545

Very funny. -

194

Are you ready for the a.S.L. Test?

195
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:40,102
×ÖÄ»
Uh, yes. You?

196
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,418

I think I understand everything.

197
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:47,280
×ÖÄ»
Mm, except for "Understand."

198
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:48,725
×ÖÄ»
This is "Understand."

199
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,625
×ÖÄ»
You signed "Horny."

200
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,659

Mm. Crap.

201
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:54,500

I haven't gotten one full sentence right.

202
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:57,874

Great, what do you think

203
00:08:57,874 --> 00:08:59,017

They've cut now?

I'm guessing I'm on the list.

210
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,204
×ÖÄ»
Bet I am too.

211
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:17,015

I'm guessing so is she.

So it's all of the pilot program kids

217
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,723
×ÖÄ»
And some of the deaf kids?

218
00:09:57,971 --> 00:09:58,812
×ÖÄ»
Yup.

219
00:09:59,296 --> 00:10:01,279

At a tolerance retreat?

220
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,000
×ÖÄ»
Mm-hmm.

221
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,222
×ÖÄ»
But there isn't a problem?

222
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,522
×ÖÄ»
Okay, maybe there were a few misunderstandings.

223
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:18,456
×ÖÄ»
But that's just because the whole thing is new to everyone.

224
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:20,344
×ÖÄ»
Bay, I know you feel like you

225
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:22,190
×ÖÄ»
have to make it sound like everything is fine

226
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,625
×ÖÄ»
Because you pushed so hard, but--

227
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,279
×ÖÄ»
Mom, everything is fine.

228
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,244
×ÖÄ»
And I promise if I need you guys,

229
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:28,916
×ÖÄ»
I will tell you, okay?

230
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:31,228
×ÖÄ»
- Okay. - Okay.

231
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,554
×ÖÄ»
Have fun.

232
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,237
×ÖÄ»
I knew this school wasn't a good idea.

233
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,114
×ÖÄ»
At buckner,

234
00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:46,750
×ÖÄ»
When there were problems with groups of kids,

235
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,519
×ÖÄ»
We would have assemblies-- we'd do trust falls in the gym

236
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,865
×ÖÄ»
Or pass around like a talking stick.

237
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:55,125
×ÖÄ»
We were not sent into the woods to reenact "The hunger games."

238
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:56,741
×ÖÄ»
Maybe you should have thought about that

239
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:59,079
×ÖÄ»
Before you hit natalie with a volleyball.

240
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:01,423
×ÖÄ»
I apologized for that.

241
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:04,036
×ÖÄ»
And then she was the one who bombed my locker.

242
00:11:04,036 --> 00:11:07,426
×ÖÄ»
Oh, so you're just an innocent victim in all of this.

243
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:09,956
×ÖÄ»
I told I was sorry you and the leadership kids

244
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:13,237
×ÖÄ»
Got dragged into this, but maybe if you weren't

245
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,249
×ÖÄ»
Such an upstanding student--

246
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:16,409
×ÖÄ»
Wait, now it's my fault

247
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,982
×ÖÄ»
that I have to spend my weekend doing this?

248
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:19,950
×ÖÄ»
No, I'm just saying it's not my fault.

249
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,590
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I was supposed to bring my mom

250
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,772
×ÖÄ»
To the spa this weekend,

251
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,444
×ÖÄ»
Because she was feeling so bad about angelo

252
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:26,651
×ÖÄ»
And his new baby.

253
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,377
×ÖÄ»
Something that you didn't bother telling me about.

254
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:31,236
×ÖÄ»
Why didn't you tell me?

255
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,257
×ÖÄ»
I should have, I know.

256
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:37,732
×ÖÄ»
But when I found out, regina didn't know.

257
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:41,116
×ÖÄ»
And then angelo and I got into this big fight.

258
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:43,040
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:43,857 --> 00:11:45,522
×ÖÄ»
I have to go get the rest of my stuff.

260
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:54,110
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I guess I'm ready to go.

261
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:56,597
×ÖÄ»
Try not to be too mad at bay.

262
00:11:56,597 --> 00:11:58,867
×ÖÄ»
I'm sure she feels bad about all of this too.

263
00:11:59,125 --> 00:11:59,971
×ÖÄ»
I know. I just--

264
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:03,073
×ÖÄ»
I was really looking forward to spending time with you.

265
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,026
×ÖÄ»
Me too.

266
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:06,492
×ÖÄ»
but we can just do next weekend.

267
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:10,094
×ÖÄ»
And while you're gone I can catch up on "Breaking bad"

268
00:12:10,094 --> 00:12:12,415
×ÖÄ»
And count the amount of times grandma says "I told you so."

269
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,760
×ÖÄ»
Hey.

270
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,017
×ÖÄ»
Why don't you come with us?

271
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:18,523
×ÖÄ»
- On the retreat? - Yeah.

272
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:19,145
×ÖÄ»
Why not?

273
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:20,896
×ÖÄ»
You can hang out with melody,

274
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:21,944
×ÖÄ»
Eat s'mores,

275
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,819
×ÖÄ»
Avoid grandma.

276
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:25,545
×ÖÄ»
I do make a mean s'more.

277
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,829
×ÖÄ»
You really do.

278
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:30,397
×ÖÄ»
You know what? I think that's a great idea.

279
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:31,942
×ÖÄ»
I have a doctor's appointment in the afternoon,

280
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:32,926
×ÖÄ»
But I can meet you up there.

281
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:34,588
×ÖÄ»
Are you having more problems with your hands?

282
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,330
×ÖÄ»
Actually, no.

283
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,982
×ÖÄ»
Um, this is somebody new and she's run lots of tests

284
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:42,501
×ÖÄ»
And seems optimistic. I'm hoping for good news.

285
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:44,370
×ÖÄ»
- That's so great! - I know.

286
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:45,961
×ÖÄ»
Come as soon as you can.

287
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,923
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

288
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,738
×ÖÄ»
And you didn't know two weeks ago that

289
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,327
×ÖÄ»
The parts needed to come from germany?

290
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:53,982
×ÖÄ»
We hoped we could get them locally.

291
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,321
×ÖÄ»
Well, my insurance won't cover any more rental car days.

292
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:57,259
×ÖÄ»
I'm really sorry.

293
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,933
×ÖÄ»
I am a pregnant woman walking eight blocks

To and from the bus stop every day.

295
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:03,147

My wife has had four kids.

296
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:05,507
×ÖÄ»
She says exercise is good for you and the baby.

297
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:06,685
×ÖÄ»
Helps with the delivery.

298
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,184
×ÖÄ»
Oh, really? Dr. Larry.

299
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:10,799
×ÖÄ»
Is there any other medical advice you would like

300
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,470
×ÖÄ»
To give me or my unborn child?

301
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:15,012

- Hi. - We are not done here.

302
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:16,407

No, sorry. Um--

00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:19,410
×ÖÄ»
- Don't know if you remember me, but-- - yeah.

304
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,100
×ÖÄ»
From angelo's place.

305
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,447
×ÖÄ»
Right. Yeah. Can I help?

306
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:24,437
×ÖÄ»
I swear her car will be ready tomorrow.

307
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,559
×ÖÄ»
Well, mine's done now. I could give you

308
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,390
×ÖÄ»
A ride home today and

309
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,824

00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:30,670

Tomorrow.

311
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,278

As god as my witness.

312
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:38,830
×ÖÄ»
Um, okay, I-- I really don't wanna put you out.

313
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:39,972

You're not.

Okay. Thanks.

Ah, I really don't see a problem then.

333
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:38,191
×ÖÄ»
Whoa, how much contraband have you consumed?

334
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,277
×ÖÄ»
Noah, whoa! Are you okay?

335
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:43,932
×ÖÄ»
I just need a minute.

336
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:47,718
×ÖÄ»
What's going on?

337
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:50,730
×ÖÄ»
Um...

338
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:53,857
×ÖÄ»
I have this thing

339
00:14:55,176 --> 00:14:56,588
×ÖÄ»
Called meniere's disease.

340
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,477
×ÖÄ»
It messes with my-- my balance and my hearing and stuff.

341
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,923
×ÖÄ»
What do you mean "Messes with"?

342
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:09,421
×ÖÄ»
Uh, I just get dizzy spells.

343
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:12,030
×ÖÄ»
They last for a few minutes or all day.

344
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:15,180
×ÖÄ»
I've lost 60% of the hearing in my right ear.

345
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:17,656
×ÖÄ»
And eventually...

346
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:18,994
×ÖÄ»
I could lose it all.

347
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:21,907
×ÖÄ»
When we went around in the circle that first day,

348
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:24,047
×ÖÄ»
I thought you said you were at carlton

349
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:25,648
×ÖÄ»
Because you had deaf relatives.

350
00:15:25,648 --> 00:15:26,562
×ÖÄ»
Yeah, my uncle.

351
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:28,096
×ÖÄ»
He's got meniere's too.

352
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:29,702
×ÖÄ»
- - right.

353
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:31,648
×ÖÄ»
My parents figured that it'd be good

354
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:33,879
×ÖÄ»
To get a head start on the whole hand thing.

355
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:37,445
×ÖÄ»
It's incredible, you know?

356
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:39,983
×ÖÄ»
One day you're fine, and the next...

357
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:41,654
×ÖÄ»
Whole life changes.

358
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:45,839
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

359
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,028
×ÖÄ»
It's crazy how that can happen.

360
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,478
×ÖÄ»
Why didn't you just tell everybody

361
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,420
×ÖÄ»
That you have meniere's?

362
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,149
×ÖÄ»
I don't really like to talk about it.

363
00:15:58,186 --> 00:15:59,091
×ÖÄ»
Well...

364
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:02,572
×ÖÄ»
You wanna hear my "Your whole life changes in a day" Story?

365
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:05,631
×ÖÄ»
you've got one too?

366
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,214
×ÖÄ»
Get comfortable.

367
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:13,416
×ÖÄ»
so we took this blood test in bio class and, well...

368
00:16:15,762 --> 00:16:19,174
×ÖÄ»
Welcome. I can see you're all very excited to be here.

369
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,025
×ÖÄ»
Well, you have been selected to participate

370
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,468
×ÖÄ»
In this team-building weekend because...

371
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:28,221
×ÖÄ»
You are either a role model at carlton,

372
00:16:28,664 --> 00:16:29,936
×ÖÄ»
A troublemaker...

373
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:31,486
×ÖÄ»
Or a target.

374
00:16:32,342 --> 00:16:33,688
×ÖÄ»
Your first assignment

375
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:35,529
×ÖÄ»
Will be to replicate

376
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,953
×ÖÄ»
The object that's under this tarp.

377
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:40,697
×ÖÄ»
You will be split up into groups of five--

378
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,968
×ÖÄ»
One looker, two runners

379
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:46,906
×ÖÄ»
And two builders.

380
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:49,029
×ÖÄ»
You'll get the hang of it.

381
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:50,446
×ÖÄ»
Now before you start out,

382
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:53,012
×ÖÄ»
Please remember: You must always sign.

383
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:55,359
×ÖÄ»
Okay.

384
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:56,078
×ÖÄ»
First group:

385
00:16:57,202 --> 00:16:58,113
×ÖÄ»
Daphne.

00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:01,357
×ÖÄ»
Natalie.

00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,481
×ÖÄ»
Bay.

388
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:06,315
×ÖÄ»
Noah.

389
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:08,490
×ÖÄ»
And emmett.

390
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,743
×ÖÄ»
Second group:

391
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:17,347
×ÖÄ»
Jennifer.

392
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:18,482
×ÖÄ»
Tony.

00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:20,142
×ÖÄ»
Amy.

394
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:22,015
×ÖÄ»
Howard.

395
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:23,593
×ÖÄ»
And liz.

396
00:17:25,264 --> 00:17:27,173
×ÖÄ»
So kathryn, what do you call this dish?

397
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,179
×ÖÄ»
Just what it is--

398
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,003
×ÖÄ»
Pork chops, black beans

399
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:32,127
×ÖÄ»
- And salsa. - That is so good!

400
00:17:32,414 --> 00:17:35,599
×ÖÄ»
Now I taste the cinnamon. But what else?

401
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:38,628
×ÖÄ»
Cumin, a little chili powder, ginger.

402
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:39,623
×ÖÄ»
It's a rub.

403
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:42,325
×ÖÄ»
And can you tell our listeners how you came up with this

404
00:17:42,325 --> 00:17:43,556
×ÖÄ»
Delectable combination?

405
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:46,995
×ÖÄ»
Actually, um...

406
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:49,492
×ÖÄ»
I got this recipe a long time ago

407
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:50,946
×ÖÄ»
From this guy who works for john

408
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:53,041
×ÖÄ»
At the car wash-- hector gonzales.

409
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:57,037
×ÖÄ»
I believe it's a variation on a guatemalan dish.

410
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:58,849
×ÖÄ»
- Interesting. - Yeah.

411
00:17:58,849 --> 00:18:00,105
×ÖÄ»
Hector started out on the line

412
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:01,516
×ÖÄ»
At john's first car wash.

413
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:03,054
×ÖÄ»
And when he opened two more,

414
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:04,528
×ÖÄ»
He promoted him to manager.

415
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:05,763
×ÖÄ»
He did a great job.

416
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:07,371
×ÖÄ»
Is that when he gave you this recipe?

417
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:08,748
×ÖÄ»
I-- I--

418
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:10,262
×ÖÄ»
I don't quite remember.

419
00:18:10,262 --> 00:18:11,744
×ÖÄ»
But it's so great because

420
00:18:11,744 --> 00:18:15,541
×ÖÄ»
John never forgets that we are a nation of immigrants.

421
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,414
×ÖÄ»
And he believes that we should be finding

422
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:19,679
×ÖÄ»
Legal ways to welcome people

423
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,082
×ÖÄ»
Who want to be part of this great american dream.

424
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:24,631
×ÖÄ»
Not putting up barriers to push them out.

425
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,544
×ÖÄ»
That is very admirable.

426
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:30,819
×ÖÄ»
Does your family eat a lot of latin-inspired dishes?

427
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,873
×ÖÄ»
We're very inclusive.

428
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:35,089
×ÖÄ»
We eat all kinds of food.

429
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:40,959
×ÖÄ»
So can I burn this thing now?

430
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:43,342
×ÖÄ»
I'm afraid the news isn't good.

431
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:45,870
×ÖÄ»
But I'm feeling better.

432
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,871
×ÖÄ»
That's because you haven't

433
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:48,802
×ÖÄ»
been doing anything to irritate the problem.

434
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,313
×ÖÄ»
Cutting hair, signing, painting.

435
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:53,268
×ÖÄ»
The m.R.I. Shows the beginnings

436
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:55,556
×ÖÄ»
Of osteonecrosis in your wrists.

437
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,600
×ÖÄ»
And that's bad?

438
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,286
×ÖÄ»
It can be.

439
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:06,239
×ÖÄ»
If you don't make some changes soon,

440
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:09,185
×ÖÄ»
It'll be hard to turn a doorknob,

441
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:11,940
×ÖÄ»
Hold a hairbrush, drive a car.

442
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:16,708
×ÖÄ»
Okay, so what do I need to do to make it better?

443
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,531
×ÖÄ»
At this point,

444
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,018
×ÖÄ»
It's about not making it worse.

445
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:22,643
×ÖÄ»
I'll just find someone else.

446
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:24,991
×ÖÄ»
Regina.

447
00:19:26,451 --> 00:19:28,503
×ÖÄ»
You've seen over a dozen specialists.

448
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:31,434
×ÖÄ»
At some point it's not about giving up.

449
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:34,493
×ÖÄ»
It's just simply about accepting your new reality.

450
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:42,656
×ÖÄ»
â™?I waited for your call

451
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:43,953
×ÖÄ»

×ÖÄ»
â™?To release me from

×ÖÄ»
All right, an art project. We are so gonna win this.

455
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:55,318

456
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:57,345

457
00:19:57,586 --> 00:19:59,270
×ÖÄ»
Okay, I didn't get all of that,

458
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,252
×ÖÄ»
But I'm pretty sure it was insulting.

459
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:01,362

And he's not feeling well.

661
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,050
×ÖÄ»
You do not know how I feel.

662
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,620
×ÖÄ»
And if you really think that I am not trying hard enough,

663
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,260
×ÖÄ»
You are most certainly not my friend.

664
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,210
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry.

665
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,630
×ÖÄ»
I,uh... I haven't figured out How to do that

666
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,860
×ÖÄ»
Without,uh,scaring someone

667
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,230
×ÖÄ»
Who can't hear me coming.

668
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,640
×ÖÄ»
It's okay.

669
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,540
×ÖÄ»
Are you okay?

670
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,170
×ÖÄ»
Can I help?

671
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,550
×ÖÄ»
Not unless you're a wizard Or a magician.

672
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,250
×ÖÄ»
I don't think so.

673
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,850
×ÖÄ»
But,um, Harry potter didn't find out

674
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,650
×ÖÄ»
That he was a wizard until he was like... 15.

675
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,330
×ÖÄ»
So... There's always a chance.

676
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,420
×ÖÄ»
11.

677
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,390
×ÖÄ»
Harry potter was 11 when he found out he was a wizard.

678
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,640
×ÖÄ»
Oh,right. My bad.

679
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,980
×ÖÄ»
I just found out That my mom can't sign to me ever again.

680
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,860
×ÖÄ»
She has some Weird physical thing

681
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,110
×ÖÄ»
Messing up her hands.

682
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,330
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry.

683
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,100
×ÖÄ»
You're not deaf. You don't get it.

684
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,930
×ÖÄ»
You have no idea how exhausting it is

685
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,930
×ÖÄ»
To have to read lips all the time.

686
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,500
×ÖÄ»
Imagine you found out that your parents

687
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,750
×ÖÄ»
Could never talk to you with their voice ever again.

688
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,180
×ÖÄ»
You had to sign with them for the rest of your life.

689
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,420
×ÖÄ»
I'm imagining.

690
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,330
×ÖÄ»
If it you makes you,um, Feel any better...

691
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,890
×ÖÄ»
She's probably a million times madder than you are.

692
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,650
×ÖÄ»
It sucks to feel like your body's betraying you.

693
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,420
×ÖÄ»
I'll see you back at camp.

694
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,240
×ÖÄ»
I just got off the phone with ivan

695
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,280
×ÖÄ»
Who told me that I need to reign in my wife.

696
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,990
×ÖÄ»
- Excuse me? - Yeah.

697
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,750
×ÖÄ»
Guy's really got a way with words,but the radio show...

698
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,310
×ÖÄ»
You were just supposed to talk about recipes.

699
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,570
×ÖÄ»
The only non-food thing I said was

700
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,390
×ÖÄ»
that you believe that new immigrants

701
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,030
×ÖÄ»
Should get a shot at the american dream. Is that so bad?

702
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,610
×ÖÄ»
Apparently sawyer is already spinning it...

703
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,900
×ÖÄ»
Saying that I encourage illegal immigration.

704
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,200
×ÖÄ»
But that's absurd. Hector's legal.

705
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,820
×ÖÄ»
- All your guys are legal. - But you didn't say that.

706
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,530
×ÖÄ»
Fine,we'll go the press tomorrow with the facts.

707
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,850
×ÖÄ»
No,the point is that it is easy to make mistakes.

708
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,460
×ÖÄ»
That is why ivan wants to keep the message general.

709
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,330
×ÖÄ»
You know,we don't want to waste time going on the defensive,

710
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,450
×ÖÄ»
Doing damage control.

711
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,080
×ÖÄ»
So that's how you wanna win this thing?

712
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,590
×ÖÄ»
By saying nothing of substance?

713
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,740
×ÖÄ»
I have spent a lot of my life

714
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,600
×ÖÄ»
Thinking I was just a dumb jock.

715
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,690
×ÖÄ»
That is your father talking.

716
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,540
×ÖÄ»
But if I am elected, I can really do something meaningful.

717
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,480
×ÖÄ»
I can make a difference in how our kids are educated,

718
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,580
×ÖÄ»
In whether or not people get jobs, Can own their own homes.

719
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,230
×ÖÄ»
But I can't do that

720
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,190
×ÖÄ»
If I don't win.

721
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,080
×ÖÄ»
Then tell people your ideas.

722
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,610
×ÖÄ»
Let them vote for something.

723
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,930
×ÖÄ»
I'm sorry, But I think ivan is right.

724
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:29,370
×ÖÄ»
If you're in the stronger position, You don't get aggressive,

725
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:33,100
×ÖÄ»
You hold steady and you let the other team Make the mistakes.

726
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,960
×ÖÄ»
No more talking politics.

727
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,350
×ÖÄ»
Fine.

728
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,420
×ÖÄ»
Then consider your wife reigned in.

729
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,310
×ÖÄ»
as the sun shines on

730
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,380
×ÖÄ»
my face

731
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,820
×ÖÄ»
it's true--

732
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,310
×ÖÄ»
- Wow,payback's a bitch. - Payback?

733
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,210
×ÖÄ»
Yeah,I snuck up on somebody earlier.

734
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,510
×ÖÄ»
never mind. How'd you find me here?

735
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,550
×ÖÄ»
Used my superpowers.

736
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,420
×ÖÄ»
I heard the singing. Don't tell anyone.

737
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,080
×ÖÄ»
Well,with my a. S. L. Skills,

10738
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,700

I don't think you have to worry about me Telling anybody anything.

739
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,430
×ÖÄ»
True.

740
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,520
×ÖÄ»
I just wanted some space.

741
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,950
×ÖÄ»
And I think your boyfriend wanted to see a little less of me too.

742
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,200
×ÖÄ»
Come on. He was giving me the stink eye all day.

743
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,840
×ÖÄ»
I kind of put it together.

744
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,950
×ÖÄ»
Emmett's not my boyfriend.

745
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,460
×ÖÄ»
He was.

746
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,880

00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,330
×ÖÄ»
Seriously?

00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,490
×ÖÄ»
Yeah.

755
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,780
×ÖÄ»
Am I an idiot? 'cause I don't really get that.

756
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:11,090
×ÖÄ»
I'm just saying going deaf may not be what you think it is.

757
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,320

I hope not.

Okay. So why don't we call a truce?

I can't stop thinking about what you said last night at the hospital.

775
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,490
×ÖÄ»
About putting the baby up for adoption

776
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,530
×ÖÄ»
And not having the family around.

777
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,700
×ÖÄ»
I shouldn't have even mentioned that.
