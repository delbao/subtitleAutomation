1
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,814
This is a story about a lovely couple,
Rob and Elaine...

2
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:55,183
...who rented a house one especially
hot and sticky summer in the Hamptons.

3
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:58,223
Elaine invited her best single friends,
cindy and Janet...

4
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,556
...while Rob invited his single friends,
Ira and Matthew...

5
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,597
...to share the good times
and exorbitant rent.

6
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,462
Until one day,
this lovely couple had a terrible fight...

7
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,161
...when Elaine went for a run
and twisted her ankle...

8
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:14,299
...and came back early
to find Rob canoodling with Janet.

9
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:19,406
And cindy got tired of Matthew's
idiotic jokes and incessant market chatter.

10
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:23,140
Ira tried to be there for Elaine
and confessed his true feelings for her...

11
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,377
...which she tried to laugh off as a joke.

12
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:28,579
By August, it got to the point
where everything was so awkward...

13
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,588
...that nobody wanted to come back.

14
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:33,217
And that's when Janet
called her friend charlotte.

15
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:36,019
It's a really cute three-bedroom cottage.

16
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,962
They're giving us a fantastic deal
for the month of August.

17
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:43,196
Because it's haunted with
cheating boyfriends and sexual rejection.

18
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,760
We can always burn sage.

19
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:48,295
Sharing a house with your girlfriends
is fine in your 20s...

20
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:53,175
...but in your 30s, isn't it a bit pathetic,
like being the oldest kid at summer camp?

21
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,610
She has a point.

22
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,115
My 25-year-old assistant, Nina Grabowski...

23
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,084
...has a summer share in Bridgehampton
with 18 other girls.

24
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,884
They sleep in shifts.

25
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,751
- What if they meet someone?
- They fuck in shifts, too.

26
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,116
Hold it.

27
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:10,457
I can't believe you guys would pass up
a chance to get out of this heat.

28
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,124
Besides, the city's completely dead
during August.

29
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:17,566
- Because everyone's in the Hamptons.
- Or stuck in traffic trying to get there.

30
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,835
This could be the last summer we can all
get together and do something like this.

31
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,676
I mean, next year, who knows?
One of us could be married or have kids.

32
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:31,479
And we'll always regret that last summer
we didn't spend together in the Hamptons.

33
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,751
Charlotte's sweet hopefulness
touched something in all of us.

34
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,691
- Okay, I'm in.
- Me, too.

35
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,918
Fine, but I get the late shift.

36
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,825
Samantha always felt like
she was in her 20s...

37
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:50,300
...until seeing an actual twenty-something
brought her down to earth.

38
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,067
No, I'm getting you on the VIP list.
You have to try it for one night.

39
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:57,336
My best friend Jerry owns it.
He also owns the one in South Beach.

40
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,570
Yes, the same one.

41
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:01,670
Proof and confirm the guest list
for the Hetrick-Martin benefit.

42
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,511
And get me Richard Johnson, ASAP.

43
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:08,411
He is not a fag, because I happen to have
three friends he's personally fucked.

44
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,817
You are nasty. You are.

45
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:15,758
I'm sending you a car, to and fro, and if you
hate it, I'm gonna let you blow me. I am.

46
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,994
I am serious. Off, now.

47
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:24,300
Alec, I've gotta go.
I'll keep you posted, okay?

48
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,664
Bye, honey.

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,300
I have personal relationships of my own,
you know.

50
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,606
- Not with my clients, you don't.
- I have my career to worry about.

51
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,781
Your career is being my assistant.

52
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,847
You're so deluded. You wouldn't even
know what's hot if it wasn't for me.

53
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,188
Unfortunately you don't seem to
grasp the vast difference between us.

54
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,723
Yes, I do.

55
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,357
You stood in line at Studio 54...

56
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,522
...I stood in line at Studio 54, the movie.

57
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:59,970
I gave that bitch her first job out of
college. She didn't know a fucking thing!

58
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:03,564
Girls in their 20s, they're spoiled
and ungrateful. They think they're it.

59
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,474
Don't they realize, we're still it?

60
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,139
No, because the world validates
their delusion.

61
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,081
And she took a copy of my Rolodex.
Do you think I can sue?

62
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,979
- Do you remember us in our 20s?
- Dimly.

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,314
Have some compassion.

64
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:20,120
The only thing worse than being single
in your 30s is being single in your 20s.

65
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,490
Where've you been? I was worried
you'd miss the jitney.

66
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,257
The Hamptons Jitney is like
the bus to summer camp...

67
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:30,324
...only instead of singing everyone
ignores each other and talks on their cell.

68
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:31,768
Everyone, this is Greg.

69
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,466
This is Samantha, Carrie and Miranda.

70
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,529
Hi!

71
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:38,610
Greg's been going to the Hamptons
every summer for 20 years.

72
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,509
- Since I was six.
- You do the math.

73
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,569
I have.

74
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,246
Thank you.

75
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,484
Easy, sister, no need to push.

76
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,950
Four bumper-to-bumper hours later,
we arrived at our new digs.

77
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:02,792
They said this place was shabby chic,
I'm thinking it's much more shitty chic.

78
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,598
These towels are mildewed.

79
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,298
Actually, this whole house smells
like mildew.

80
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,675
It's not mildew, it's beachy.

81
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:13,234
Would you all stop being so cynical?
We're lucky to be here.

82
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:17,146
Cynicism. Now there's one advantage
we have over girls in their 20s.

83
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,480
I was cynical in high school.

84
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,385
Who's that?

85
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:25,581
It's Greg, that cute guy I met on the jitney.
I told him to drop by.

86
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:28,387
And if he asks, he thinks I'm 27.

87
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,119
Evidently, while we had taken
the Midtown Tunnel...

88
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,427
...charlotte had taken the time tunnel.

89
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,023
- Hi!
- Hey.

90
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,194
Come on in. You guys remember Greg.

91
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,527
Hi, Greg.

92
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,035
Hey!

93
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,937
Me and my housemates are having
a big bonfire tonight at the beach...

94
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:47,144
...and I just wanted to tell you
that you're all invited.

95
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,578
Excellent!

96
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,695
Here you go, ladies.

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,591
There's so much foam
you could ski on the head!

98
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,730
Sorry, it's been awhile
since I pumped a keg.

99
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:19,106
I love young men, but come on. The guys
here don't even have chest hair yet!

100
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,003
That's good news for their backs.

101
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,110
Sorry!

102
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,478
Okay, this is really fun.
How long do we have to stay?

103
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,257
God!

104
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,593
I'm gonna go tell Charlotte we're leaving.

105
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,096
Another thing about twenty-something
girls is they're very considerate.

106
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,827
You can always count on one of them
to hold your hair when you vomit.

107
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,501
Excuse me!

108
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,865
My God, Carrie Bradshaw!

109
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,039
- Yeah?
- Laurel Harris.

110
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,373
May I just tell you that I worship you?

111
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,005
I read your column every week,
it's like my religion.

112
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,374
Thank you.

113
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,077
I work in a publishing house,
but I'm really a writer.

114
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,119
- Great.
- We'll see.

115
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:04,989
Maybe I could send you something
to read sometime?

116
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,924
- Sure.
- That would mean so much to me.

117
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,690
To have someone like you as my mentor.

118
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:12,659
Well, mentor.

119
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,400
Could I call you sometime in the city?

120
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,334
If I could spend some time with you,
that would be so cool.

121
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,774
Of course. I'll be looking at
a very busy summer.

122
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,241
I can help.
I'll run errands, I'll do your wash.

123
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:30,571
No menial labor necessary.
I'll just give you my phone number.

124
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,614
My God, this is so cool.

125
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,919
Thank you.

126
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,884
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

127
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:45,228
The next day, Miranda woke up early
to enjoy the cool morning breeze...

128
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:48,130
...and a much-needed moment of solitude.

129
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,997
All right, somebody puked on the deck.

130
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,133
Sorry...

131
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,569
...Stacey and Holly did
too many Jell-O shots.

132
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,774
What are you, 25 now?

133
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,407
Good morning.

134
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,418
No, 27!

135
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,580
Whatever.

136
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,728
That week, back in the city,
I wondered what was the allure of the 20s?

137
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,525
On one hand, there's great skin tone,
the thrill of fresh experience...

138
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:24,535
...and the sense of a consequence-free life
full of endless possibilities.

139
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:28,937
While on the other, there are horrible
apartments, sexually inexperienced men...

140
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,136
...and embarrassing errors
in fashion judgment.

141
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:38,948
Should we fear these freshly minted, single
women as a threat to our very survival...

142
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,647
...or pity them as clueless half-wits
about to get their dreams dashed...

143
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,882
...and illusions shattered?

144
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,991
Twenty-something girls...

145
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,960
...friend or foe?

146
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,527
And that evening,
in my first act as a mentor...

147
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,800
...I took my young acolyte to a book party.

148
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:00,633
My God.

149
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,408
I can't believe I'm out with
Carrie Bradshaw. This is too cool.

150
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,742
Stop, I can feel my head swelling.

151
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,680
If it gets any bigger,
I'll have to say goodbye to my hats.

152
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,876
I have a question.

153
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,148
Do you think that 25 is too young
to write a personal memoir?

154
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:19,247
As long as it doesn't deal with incest,
Prozac, or partying, no.

155
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,459
It does deal with sex,
or rather not having sex.

156
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:26,464
It's about how girls my age
are saving themselves for marriage.

157
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,430
- Saving what for marriage?
- Our virginity.

158
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,371
Are you telling me that you've
never had sex with a man?

159
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,041
That is correct.

160
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,839
Okay, what do you consider sex?

161
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,745
Are you implying I'm
some kind of Lewinsky?

162
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,650
I'm not! I'm talking no blowjobs,
no hand jobs.

163
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,517
All right, I get it, no jobs of any kind.

164
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,519
You know what?
I think I need to get a drink.

165
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,658
- I'll get it. Cosmopolitan, right?
- Yeah.

166
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,426
I remember from your column.

167
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:06,298
A 25-year-old virgin was getting me
a cosmopolitan.

168
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,637
The generation gap
had never seemed so wide.

169
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,039
Hi.

170
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,179
- Have you actually read the book?
- No, have you?

171
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,146
Not yet.

172
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,877
Know anything about the author?

173
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:23,445
His family has a history of diabetes
and he has a steel splint in his left femur.

174
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:27,117
- I'm his doctor, Bradley Meego.
- Carrie Bradshaw.

175
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,260
My doctor won't even make house calls,
let alone attend a book party.

176
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,322
I've never been to one.
I thought it might be interesting.

177
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,231
It's exceeded all my expectations.

178
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,635
Generally, it's cheese and crackers.
You never see an actual shrimp.

179
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,797
No, I meant you.

180
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,435
I'd ask you for a drink after
but I'm driving to the Hamptons.

181
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,578
I'm going out to the Hamptons tomorrow.

182
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:50,442
Great, can I call you there?

183
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,379
All right, you know what?

184
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,944
I'll be with my friends Saturday
at Townline Beach.

185
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:59,718
A big yellow umbrella.
You can come by and say hello.

186
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,952
Is this a ploy to see me in my bathing suit?

187
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,429
- Here's your Cosmo.
- Thank you.

188
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,863
Dr. Bradley Meego, this is Laurel.

189
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,629
- Hi.
- Hey.

190
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,497
What if it rains?
Do we pick another date?

191
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,730
Doctor, you are persistent.

192
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:20,075
All right. In case of emergency, only.

193
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,615
Now I'm gonna have to buy the book.

194
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,551
Nice meeting you. You, too.

195
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,749
Drive safe.

196
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,084
My God, he is such a fox.

197
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,287
Did you meet him when I was at the bar?

198
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,966
Lady, you've got it going on!

199
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,565
That Saturday turned out
to be hot and sunny.

200
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,863
While we sat under our umbrella...

201
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,569
...twenty-something girls sizzled on the
sand like rotisserie chickens.

202
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,579
Excuse me,
when did tanning come back in style?

203
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,945
Hand me the 45!

204
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,084
Forty-five, I didn't know
it went up that high.

205
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,181
You could sit in a microwave and not burn.

206
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,917
It's Charlotte's,
but I don't think she'll be using it.

207
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,051
It's not good for her 27-year-old image.

208
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,055
She actually put on oil.

209
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,360
Just let her have her fun now.

210
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,300
Come Labor Day, she's gonna look like
a 27-year-old handbag.

211
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:21,328
I'd risk a few precancerous
freckles for a summer romance.

212
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:26,208
And right then, my summer romance
made his appearance, right on schedule.

213
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,711
Yellow umbrellas seem to be
very popular this year.

214
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,248
This is Dr. Bradley Meego.

215
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,377
Hello.

216
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,051
What kind of a doctor are you, Doctor?

217
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,750
Internal medicine.
General, all-purpose kind of thing.

218
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:42,691
Fabulous, so you can prescribe medication?

219
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,296
- What'd you have in mind?
- Feel free to ignore her.

220
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,232
I'm sure that's impossible.
I'm gonna go take a quick dip.

221
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,532
- You promise not to ditch me, now.
- I promise.

222
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,606
- Is that the guy from the book party?
- Yeah.

223
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,674
I've got to start reading.

224
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:05,210
He's cute. I'm just not
really sure I'm interested.

225
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,616
Good-Iooking, polite,
house in the Hamptons.

226
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,015
- It's good on paper.
- You know the rule.

227
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,918
Good on paper, bad in bed.

228
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,325
A "good on paper guy"
is a guy with great credentials...

229
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,093
...who you always end up leaving
for some hot guy...

230
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:24,658
...who rides a motorcycle and doesn't have
a checking account.

231
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,964
My God!

232
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,631
The water feels so awesome.
You guys should really go in.

233
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:34,072
You better put on some sunscreen,
Georgette Hamilton.

234
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,646
That's okay, I never burn.

235
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:39,343
Well, I do.
In fact, I've had enough for today.

236
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,148
I'm gonna go grocery shopping.
You guys want anything?

237
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,415
We should get some rum.
We can make Long Island Iced Teas.

238
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,159
Yes, I love Long Island Iced Teas.

239
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,585
Excellent!

240
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:59,901
I took a leap of faith
and made reservations...

241
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:03,271
...at one of those impossible-to-get-into
restaurants for tonight.

242
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,310
I'd love to...

243
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,845
...I just can't abandon my friends.

244
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:13,284
Actually, that wasn't an invitation.
It was just restaurant chitchat.

245
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,913
I'm kidding.

246
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,754
How about after dinner?

247
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,850
I've got a great little house,
cute porch we could sit on.

248
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,427
I don't know.

249
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,098
Okay, how about I just call your...

250
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,361
...in-case-of-emergency number
this weekend.

251
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,527
The emergency being,
I think I'm gonna miss you.

252
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,936
Yes, you could definitely do that.

253
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,064
Good.

254
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:41,237
Romantic, polite, and his very own house
south of the highway.

255
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,710
My good-on-paper guy
was jumping right off the page.

256
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,711
Later that afternoon, we came back from
the beach rested, rejuvenated...

257
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,550
...feeling almost 29 again.

258
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,653
Even Miranda was in good spirits.

259
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:57,127
Guys, I just got back from the market.
Fresh corn and seafood for dinner.

260
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,989
Except, your groupie can't stay.
I only got enough for the four of us.

261
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,125
She's here?

262
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:07,262
Yeah, she was asking too many inane
questions. I sent her up to your room.

263
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,569
- Thanks.
- Sorry.

264
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,644
I've got to shower, the sand is itchy
in my bathing suit, and then I'll help you.

265
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,408
Take your time. That came for you.

266
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:19,806
My God!

267
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,510
What's wrong?

268
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,919
It's for the Hamptons Hoedown
tomorrow night...

269
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:27,685
...and the event is being run by
Nina G. Public Relations. Nina G!

270
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,626
Overnight, Samantha's ex-assistant,
Nina Grabowski...

271
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,926
...had reinvented herself as Nina G.

272
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:37,492
I was up for that job and now she's using
my Rolodex to put together the guest list.

273
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,629
While Samantha was getting
fucked royally by her protege...

274
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,201
...mine was giving me the royal treatment.

275
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,039
It's not that I don't wanna
have sex with men...

276
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,046
...I feel like these previous
generations of women have...

277
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,572
...devalued sex to the point
where it's not even special anymore.

278
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:56,052
One summer, when I was 15,
I read everything Jackie Collins ever wrote.

279
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,782
I thought to myself, who cares?

280
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,551
Is it supposed to be shocking...

281
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,821
...wagging one's pussy
at every good-Iooking stud who walks by?

282
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,331
- Please.
- And what is it you like about my column?

283
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,602
I have a tiny tick on my stomach,
and I can't get it off.

284
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,269
- Does it hurt?
- No, but it itches.

285
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,897
My God, that is not a tick.

286
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,267
What is it?

287
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,970
There go our shitty sheets.

288
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,744
My God, it's so disgusting.

289
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,676
- Where's she going?
- To the drugstore.

290
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:32,454
Charlotte really is in her 20s.
She's got crabs.

291
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:34,149
My God!

292
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,826
That night, I called Dr. Meego.

293
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,228
I figured it was an emergency.

294
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,863
I have this thing about crabs.

295
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,769
I had them in college
and it scarred me for life.

296
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:50,035
I can't go back to that house
until the mattresses are sanitized...

297
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:52,167
...and the sheets and towels are burned.

298
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,542
I'm flattered you thought of me.

299
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:58,344
I'd be happy to prescribe your friend
some industrial-strength pubicide.

300
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,510
She can take care of herself.

301
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,143
Cheers.

302
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,487
You might have to spend the night here.

303
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,960
I might have to, but only to sleep.

304
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,368
Women always say that
and as soon as the lights go out...

305
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,599
...boom, they're going for my pajamas.

306
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,609
All righty. I promise, no funny stuff.

307
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:34,610
That night we slept together,
but we didn't sleep together.

308
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,312
It was really nice.

309
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:41,552
I believe it was the first instance of a case
of crabs moving a relationship forward.

310
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:52,135
Every year, one of the local
Hamptons billionaires got down and dirty...

311
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,503
...and threw a big hoedown
full of cowboys and caviar.

312
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,872
It was the event of the season.

313
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,738
We joined Samantha
to lend our moral support.

314
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,347
I can't believe it.

315
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:08,250
There're people here who don't even come
to my parties and they came to Nina's.

316
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,412
Look at her over there.

317
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,049
Beef jerky carpaccio?

318
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,118
I am just so depressed right now.
Excuse me.

319
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,924
Where are you going?

320
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:23,934
To congratulate Nina.
I may need her to hire me someday.

321
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:28,661
While Samantha set out to negotiate
twenty-something detente...

322
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,470
...charlotte prepared to launch
a full-out war.

323
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,702
Excuse me.

324
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,387
Do you know that you gave me crabs?

325
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,887
- What?
- You heard me.

326
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,330
- What makes you think it was me?
- That is so tacky.

327
00:18:57,502 --> 00:18:59,527
So is lying about your age.

328
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,866
I saw your license
when you bought the beer.

329
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,066
I didn't lie. You made an assumption,
I didn't contradict it.

330
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,132
Whatever.

331
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,804
I may have given you crabs,
but you deceived me.

332
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,811
- That is so much worse.
- Grow up.

333
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,427
You are a waitperson.
That doesn't mean wait, it means go!

334
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,297
My God, you actually came.

335
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,899
I just stopped by to wish you good luck.
It's a fabulous party.

336
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,596
That is very cool of you.

337
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,007
I told you not to seat Martha
near the hayride. She's allergic.

338
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,404
Please try to keep the young people
out until after 11:00.

339
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:48,414
We're all out of country-fried goat cheese,
somebody got stuck with a cactus needle...

340
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,149
...and there are people outside
who aren't on the list.

341
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,656
Jesus fucking Christ.
You are totally coked out.

342
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,124
You are totally jealous.

343
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,795
My God, what is that?

344
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,961
What is that sound? My God!

345
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,497
That's not supposed to happen until 12:00.

346
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,629
- I know.
- This is your problem. Get them to stop!

347
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,197
I can't, they're on a fucking barge!

348
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:15,069
Could you help me?
I need to get everybody outside.

349
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,672
I'm totally fucked right now.

350
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,110
Okay, people, fiesta fireworks, outside!

351
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,711
Let's go!

352
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,659
This is Greg.

353
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,958
I think the two of you
would really hit it off.

354
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:33,997
Hi.

355
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:41,433
I began to realize, that the biggest threat
twenty-something girls posed...

356
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,803
...was to themselves.

357
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,705
I've been looking all over for you.

358
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,507
- Look, I got one just like yours.
- That's great.

359
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,548
You want me to get you a Cosmopolitan?

360
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:53,778
No. I'm gonna go find my date.
But I'll see you later, okay?

361
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,753
That guy from the bookstore?
My God, he was so cute.

362
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,749
Annoying, yes. Dangerous, no.

363
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,052
They were simply our youthful
doppelgangers...

364
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,186
...who needed our compassion
more than anything.

365
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:10,001
And then everything I so firmly believed
was promptly blown to pieces.

366
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,272
Is it you?

367
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,440
Hey. What are you doing here?

368
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,518
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

369
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,592
I just got back this week from Paris.

370
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,356
This is Natasha.

371
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,830
Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

372
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,464
Really?

373
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,869
Natasha's parents have a house in East
Hampton. We came up for the weekend.

374
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,534
Excuse me. It's nice to meet you.

375
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:03,617
I'm sorry, I'm just a little stunned here.

376
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,113
And confused.

377
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,156
Who is she?

378
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,394
I meant to call you.

379
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,434
She's this girl that I met in Paris.

380
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,470
She works for Ralph Lauren in Europe.

381
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,203
You're in from Paris for the weekends?

382
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,838
No. The Paris deal fell through.

383
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:34,847
I planned on calling you.

384
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,718
I certainly didn't want
to run into you like this.

385
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:40,518
You can't plan everything.
Life can be pretty random.

386
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,788
I'm here on a date, too, somewhere.

387
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,660
He's a doctor, Bradley Meego.

388
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:51,130
He's good on paper, probably like Natasha.
Good-Iooking, sweet, blah-blah-blah.

389
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:55,729
How old is she, anyway?

390
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,437
I don't know, 26, 27.

391
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:03,876
Something like that.

392
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,977
I'll see you in the Hamptons
or back in the city.

393
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:13,315
I promise to call
when I get back into town.

394
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,006
Are you okay?

395
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,438
No, I just ran into Big.

396
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,173
He's back from Paris.

397
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,578
He has a new girlfriend.

398
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,179
She's 26.

399
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,177
- Where is he? I didn't see...
- God.

400
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:00,495
And then I realized...

401
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:03,302
...twenty-something girls
are just fabulous...

402
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,902
...until you see one with
the man who broke your heart.

1
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,437
欲望城市

2
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,470
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧）

3
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,409
’二十岁女孩VS三十岁女人’

4
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,780
这是关于一对爱侣
罗伯与伊莲的故事

5
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:55,011
在一个特别炎热的夏季
他们在汉普顿租了一栋别墅

6
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:58,157
伊莲邀请她最好的单身朋友
辛蒂和珍娜

7
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,452
而罗伯也邀了单身友人
艾拉和马修

8
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,596
一起共度美好时光
以及分摊过高的房租

9
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,596
直到有一天
这对爱侣起了激烈的争执

10
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,032
伊莲因慢跑时不慎扭伤脚踝
提早返家

11
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:15,002
发现罗伯和珍娜一起泛舟

12
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:19,668
辛蒂厌烦马修的白痴笑话
以及没完没了的市场经

13
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,043
艾拉则对伊莲示爱

14
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,218
她却试图一笑置之

15
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,286
到了八月，情况变得很尴尬

16
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,547
没人想再回到那个地方

17
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,225
珍娜便在此时打给夏绿蒂…

18
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:39,366
那是栋小巧的三房别墅
正适合八月去度假

19
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:44,503
-那屋里充斥求欢被拒的阴影
-我们可以烧鼠尾草

20
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:49,641
二十多岁时和女性友人
分租房子还说得过去

21
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:53,279
但到了三十几岁仍如此
不会有点可悲吗？

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,075
她说得有理，我25岁的助理

23
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:00,185
夏天在布里治汉普顿
和18个女孩一起分租房子

24
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,379
-她们得轮班睡觉
-要是有艳遇怎么办？

25
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,115
-连做爱也要排班
-慢著

26
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,353
我不敢相信
你们要放弃避暑的大好机会

27
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,032
再说，八月时
整个纽约就像死城

28
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,758
因为人人都去了汉普顿

29
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,594
或者正塞在去那里的途中

30
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:21,831
这或许是最后一个
我们能自在出游的夏天

31
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:26,569
明年，谁知道呢？
我们其中一人可能已结婚生子

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,214
我们会终生遗憾最后一个夏天

33
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,509
未能一起在汉普顿共度

34
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:35,916
夏绿蒂充满希望的甜蜜语气
打动了我们

35
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,691
-好吧，我加入
-我也是

36
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,360
好吧…

37
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,654
但我要排晚班

38
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,697
莎曼珊永远觉得
自己还是二十几岁

39
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,835
直到她看见
真正二十几岁的女人

40
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,995
你得尝试一次

41
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:58,507
屋主是我最好的朋友杰瑞
他在南滩也有一栋房子

42
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:03,615
确认宾客名单
然后尽快帮我联络理查强森

43
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:08,516
他不是同性恋
我三个朋友跟他上过床

44
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,883
你真下流

45
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:15,892
我已经把邀请卡寄给你了
如果你不喜欢，尽管找我算帐

46
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,290
我是说真的，马上去办

47
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:25,671
艾力克，我得挂了
有最新消息我再通知你

48
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,404
我有自己私人的人际关系

49
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,704
-不准勾搭我的客户
-我也要烦恼我的前途

50
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:37,077
你的前途就是担任我的助理

51
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,879
要不是我
你哪懂甚么东西才热门

52
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:45,148
妮娜，你似乎不明白
我们之间有著天壤之别

53
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,351
我当然明白
你站在夜总会门口排队

54
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,498
而我站在电影院门口排队

55
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,729
那臭丫头大学毕业第一份工作
是我给她的

56
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,602
二十几岁的女孩真是不知好歹
她们以为自己多了不起

57
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,144
-她们不懂我们仍是主流吗？
-这世界支持她们的错觉

58
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,784
她还拿走我通讯录的副本
我能告她吗？

59
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,180
-记得我们二十几岁那时吗？
-没甚么印象

60
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,550
唯一比三十几岁单身还惨的事

61
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,352
就是二十几岁时孤零零一个人

62
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,529
你们差点赶不上巴士

63
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,255
它就像开往夏令营的游览车

64
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:30,197
只不过谁也不理谁
自顾自地讲电话

65
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:35,272
各位，这是葛瑞格
她们是莎曼珊、凯莉和米兰达

66
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,376
二十年来
葛瑞格每年夏天都去汉普顿

67
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,375
-从我六岁起
-你来算年龄吧

68
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,447
-我算过了
-谢谢

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,680
别急，小姐，没必要推挤

70
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,557
在车阵中缓慢前进四小时后
我们抵达了新住处

71
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:02,668
他们说这房子有点简陋
我认为是糟透了

72
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:07,601
这些毛巾发霉了
整个房子都有霉味

73
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,604
那不是发霉，是砂砾

74
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,176
你们别再冷嘲热讽了好吗？
我们能来这里就很幸运了

75
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,009
愤世嫉俗，这是我们胜过
二十几岁女孩的优势

76
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:21,347
-我高中时就很会挖苦人
-是谁来了？

77
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,182
是葛瑞格
我在巴士上认识的那个帅哥

78
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:28,384
我叫他过来坐一下
如果他问起，就说我27岁

79
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,563
当我们穿越城中隧道来到此地

80
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:34,825
夏绿蒂已穿越了时光隧道

81
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,196
快进来
你们还记得葛瑞格吧？

82
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,997
你好，葛瑞格

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,006
我和我室友今晚要在沙滩
办一个盛大的营火派对

84
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,237
-你们都被邀请了
-太棒了

85
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,892
各位，拿去吧

86
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,696
泡沫好多
简直可以在上面滑雪了

87
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,667
我已经很久没用唧筒了

88
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:19,436
我爱年轻小伙子
但这里的男人连胸毛都没有

89
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,910
这对他们的背部是好消息

90
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,814
抱歉

91
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:29,250
真是有趣极了
我们还要待多久？

92
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,187
天啊

93
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:35,887
我去跟夏绿蒂说我们要走了

94
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:39,088
二十几岁的女孩非常体贴

95
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,791
当你呕吐时
她们会帮你把头发撩起来

96
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,129
不好意思

97
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,068
我的天，你是凯莉布雷萧？

98
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,403
我叫萝拉哈里斯
我一定要告诉你我有多崇拜你

99
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,912
-我每个礼拜都读你的专栏
-谢谢

100
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:01,019
我在一家出版社当助理
但我其实是个作家

101
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:05,021
也许改天我能把我的文章
寄给你看看吗？

102
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,522
当然可以

103
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,421
你不知道能有像你这样的人

104
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,495
做我的良师意义多么重大

105
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,361
-良师…
-回城里我能打电话给你吗？

106
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,298
我能跟你见面吗？

107
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,833
当然，不过这个夏天我会很忙

108
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,306
我可以帮你跑腿、洗衣服

109
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:30,677
不需要干仆人的活儿
我把电话号码给你

110
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:35,753
-我的天，真是太酷了
-谢谢

111
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:45,095
隔天，米兰达一早起床
享受清晨的微风

112
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,392
以及更为必要的独处时光

113
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,906
-有人在门口呕吐
-抱歉

114
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,205
史黛西和荷莉喝太多酒了

115
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,042
你以为你现在几岁，25吗？

116
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,384
早安

117
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:12,024
-不，27岁
-随便

118
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:16,753
回到城里
我纳闷二十多岁的魅力是甚么

119
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,490
气色很好
对新奇的体验感到兴奋

120
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,500
不计后果
充满无限可能的人生

121
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:28,730
同时住很糟糕的公寓
交往没有性经验的男友

122
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:33,412
以及穿没有品味的衣服

123
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,381
我们是否该担心
这些年轻的单身女子

124
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,051
对我们的生存造成威胁？

125
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:44,849
或者同情她们
幻想即将破灭却一无所知？

126
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:49,358
二十多岁的女孩
是朋友…还是敌人？

127
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,723
那晚，身为良师的第一件事

128
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,902
我带著我年轻的门徒
参加一个新书派对

129
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,399
我的天

130
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,406
我真不敢相信
我和凯莉布雷萧一起出现

131
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:10,675
够了，若我的头继续变大
我就必须和我的帽子道别

132
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:15,116
我有个问题，25岁写回忆录
会不会太年轻？

133
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,451
只要里面没提到乱伦
百忧解或狂欢就不会

134
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,423
它探讨性
或者应该说是没做爱

135
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:27,430
它是关于我这年纪的女孩
为了婚姻保有处女之身

136
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:31,462
-为了婚姻保有甚么？
-贞操

137
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,505
你的意思是
你从没和男人上过床？

138
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,939
没错

139
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,239
你认为性是甚么？

140
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,746
你在暗示我跟莒恩丝基一样？

141
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,818
不，我是指口交、手淫都不算

142
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,684
我懂了，任何费力的事都不算

143
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,587
你知道吗？
我想我需要喝杯饮料

144
00:09:54,794 --> 00:10:00,357
我去拿，四海为家，对吗？
我记得…你专栏中写过

145
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:06,437
一个25岁的处女
正帮我去拿四海为家

146
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,631
世代鸿沟从未显得如此深远

147
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,304
-嗨
-嗨

148
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,572
-你读过这本书了吗？
-还没

149
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,149
你呢？你对作者有何认识？

150
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,049
他的家族有糖尿病遗传
而他左股骨上了夹板

151
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:27,818
-我是他的医生，布莱德米哥
-我是凯莉布雷萧

152
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,155
我的医生平常连电话都不打
更别说是来参加新书派对

153
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:36,165
我想这可能会很有趣
现在已经超出我的期望了

154
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,599
通常，连只真正的虾子也没有

155
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,307
不，我是指你

156
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:45,477
等会我很想约你一起喝东西
但我要开车去汉普顿

157
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,704
事实上，我明天也要去汉普顿

158
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,713
太好了，我可以打电话给你吗

159
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,915
星期六我跟我朋友
会去唐莱海滩

160
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,853
寻找很大的黄色遮阳伞
你可以来打个招呼

161
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,926
这是为了看我穿泳衣的计谋吗

162
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,256
这是你的酒，小姐

163
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:09,492
他是布莱德米哥医生
她是萝拉

164
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,502
万一下雨怎么办？
要另外定约会吗？

165
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,936
医生，你还真是不屈不挠

166
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:20,440
好吧，除非有急事才打

167
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:31,484
现在我得买下这本书了
很高兴认识你，你也是

168
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,716
小心开车

169
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:38,226
他真迷人，你是在我去吧台时
认识他的吗？

170
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,191
小姐，真有你的

171
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,666
那个星期六炎热又晴朗

172
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,771
当我们坐在遮阳伞下时

173
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:52,604
二十多岁的女孩
像烤肉般发出嘶嘶声

174
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,508
请问古铜色皮肤
何时又开始流行了？

175
00:11:55,715 --> 00:12:00,345
-把防晒系数45的拿给我
-我不知道有出到这么高系数

176
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,249
你可以待在微波炉中而不灼伤

177
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,822
这是夏绿蒂的
但我不认为她会用

178
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,461
这不符合她27岁的形象

179
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,495
她竟然还抹了油

180
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:17,294
到时候，她看起来
便会像个27岁的手提包

181
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:21,564
我愿意为了夏日恋情
甘冒长癌症雀斑之险

182
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,935
就在此时
我夏日恋情的男主角

183
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,168
准时出现了

184
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,280
黄色遮阳伞今年似乎非常流行

185
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:30,679
嗨

186
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,453
莎曼珊、米兰达
这位是布莱德米哥医生

187
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:37,452
你是哪一科的医生，大夫？

188
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,750
甚么都看，可以说是万事通

189
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,826
太棒了，那么你能开药方？

190
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:46,487
-你有甚么意见？
-别理她

191
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,667
我要去冲个澡
你保证不丢下我？

192
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,430
我保证

193
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,641
他是你在新书派对上认识的？

194
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,779
我得开始阅读了

195
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,644
他很可爱
我只是不太确定有没有兴趣

196
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:09,185
人长得帅、又有礼貌
在汉普顿有房子

197
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,821
擅长理论

198
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:14,982
你知道那定律
擅长理论的人床上功夫很差劲

199
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,396
擅长理论的男人
拥有出色的背景资历

200
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:23,433
最后你却永远会为了一个
骑摩托车的浪子离他而去

201
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,667
海水真是棒呆了
你们应该下去玩一玩

202
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,210
你最好擦一点防晒油

203
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,610
-没关系，我从来不会晒伤
-我会

204
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:42,220
我要去买点东西
你们想要甚么吗？

205
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,946
兰姆酒，我们可以做长岛冰茶

206
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,355
好，我爱死长岛冰茶了

207
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,585
太棒了

208
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:02,702
我在一家很热门的餐厅订位了

209
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:08,370
我很想去
但我不能就这样丢下我的朋友

210
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:13,145
其实这并不是邀请
我只是随口提起

211
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,155
开玩笑的

212
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:21,994
那晚餐之后呢？
我们可以在阳台上坐坐

213
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,060
我不知道

214
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:29,326
好吧，这个周末
我打你的紧急电话如何？

215
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,936
紧急状况是
我猜我会开始想你

216
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,905
好，你当然可以这么做

217
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:41,341
浪漫、殷勤
加上他在公路南方拥有的房子

218
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,142
这个擅长理论的男人
正从纸上一跃而出

219
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:50,653
我们从海滩返回别墅时
感觉彷佛又是29岁般年轻

220
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,552
连米兰达心情都很好

221
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,025
我刚从市场回来
晚餐有新鲜的玉米和海产

222
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:02,167
你的崇拜者不能留下来，凯莉
我只准备了四人份

223
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,561
她在这里？

224
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:07,239
她问太多问题了
我让她去你房间

225
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,499
-谢了
-对不起

226
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,143
我得把身上的沙冲乾净
然后就去帮你

227
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:17,043
慢慢来
莎曼珊，那封信是你的

228
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,681
-我的天
-怎么了？

229
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,787
明晚是汉普顿的土风舞晚会

230
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,426
由妮娜Ｇ公关公司举办

231
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:32,963
一夜之间，莎曼珊的前助理
便将自己重新塑造成为妮娜Ｇ

232
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:37,397
她用我的通讯录制作宾客名单

233
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,800
当莎曼珊被她的手下
狠狠摆了一道

234
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,031
我的门徒正给我女王般的待遇

235
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,177
不是我不想跟男人上床

236
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,281
但以前的女人贬低了性的价值

237
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,542
因此它甚至不再特别了

238
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:56,415
我15岁时
我读每本杰姬柯林斯的作品

239
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,182
当时我在想
「这应该是惊人的吗？」

240
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:03,726
「对每个经过的性感男人
搔首弄姿？」

241
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,489
你到底喜欢我专栏哪一点？

242
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,661
我肚子上有个虱子，我弄不掉

243
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,303
-会痛吗？
-不，但会痒

244
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:17,374
-我的天，那不是虱子
-那是甚么？

245
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:26,076
-都是可恶的床单害的
-好恶心

246
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,753
-她要去哪里？
-去药房

247
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:34,290
夏绿蒂真的回到二十几岁了
她身上有阴虱

248
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:40,591
当晚，我打给米哥医生
我想这算是紧急情况

249
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:46,628
我大学时长过一次阴虱
害我一辈子留下疤痕

250
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:52,003
我得等床单和毛巾都烧掉
才能回去

251
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,441
我很高兴你想到了我

252
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:58,674
我很乐意为你朋友
开一点杀菌药

253
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,682
我想她能照顾自己

254
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,582
乾杯

255
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,559
你可能得在这里过夜

256
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,236
-可能，不过只是睡觉而已
-女人总是这么说

257
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:22,430
灯一关掉
她们就来脱我的睡衣

258
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:27,078
我保证没有滑稽的玩意儿

259
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,249
我们同床，但并未上床
那感觉好极了

260
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:41,222
这是第一件
阴虱让感情有所进展的案例

261
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:51,394
每年，本地的有钱人

262
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:55,437
都会办一个挤满牛仔
和鱼子酱的盛大土风舞会

263
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,269
这是社交季的大事

264
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,612
我们陪莎曼珊出席
给予她精神支持

265
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:07,946
有人不参加我办的派对
却参加妮娜办的

266
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,379
你看看她

267
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,115
来点生腌牛肉乾？

268
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:18,057
我现在真的非常沮丧，失陪

269
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,427
-你要去哪里
-去恭喜妮娜

270
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,092
有一天我可能得靠她
赏我一口饭吃

271
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,773
当莎曼珊出发去向
二十多岁的女孩低头

272
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,602
夏绿蒂则准备发动战争

273
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,041
不好意思

274
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,256
你知道你把阴虱传染给我吗？

275
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,024
-甚么？
-你听到了

276
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,430
-你凭甚么认为是我？
-那真是太低级了

277
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,004
你谎报年龄还不是一样
昨晚我看到你的驾照了

278
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:06,304
我没有说谎
是你这么假设，我没反驳而已

279
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:11,108
也许阴虱是我传染给你的
但你欺骗我

280
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,377
-这严重多了
-成熟点吧

281
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:25,163
你是个接待员
没做好份内事就滚吧

282
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,390
我的天，你真的来了

283
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,827
我只是来祝福你好运

284
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:35,666
-这是个很棒的派对
-你真好

285
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,105
我不希望玛莎乘乾草卡车
她会过敏

286
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:44,214
你能让年轻人一直到11点
都待在外头吗？

287
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:48,648
羊酪已经没了
还有人被仙人掌刺到

288
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,220
外面有不在
宾客名单上的人要进来

289
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,951
-你办事能力真差
-你太小心眼了

290
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,528
那是甚么？我的天啊
那是甚么？

291
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,461
那应该等到午夜才放的

292
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,534
-我知道
-这是你的问题

293
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:10,505
-叫他们停下来
-不行，他们在该死的游艇上

294
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,975
莎曼珊，你能帮我吗？
我需要让大家到外面去

295
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,944
我现在把一切都搞砸了

296
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:24,953
各位，外面在放烟火
我们往外移动吧

297
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:31,854
妮娜，这是葛瑞格
我想你们两个将会一见如故

298
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,934
我发现二十多岁的女孩

299
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,869
所造成的最大威胁
是对她们自己

300
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,739
我到处找你
你看，我有条跟你一样的项

301
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,575
-那很好
-你要来杯四海为家吗？

302
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,809
我要去找我的男伴了，待会见

303
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,045
那个在书店认识的男人？
他好帅

304
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:02,023
她们的确烦人，却不危险
只不过是我们年轻时的翻版

305
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,424
需要我们的同情甚过一切

306
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:10,068
接著我所坚信的一切马上瓦解

307
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:26,512
-是你吗？
-你怎么会在这里？

308
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:31,687
我怎么会在这里？
那你又怎么会在这里？

309
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,718
我刚从巴黎回来

310
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,460
凯莉，这是娜塔莎

311
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,758
很高兴认识你
我听说许多有关你的事

312
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,333
是吗？

313
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:48,836
娜塔莎的父母在这里有栋别墅
我们只是周末来度假

314
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,636
抱歉失陪，幸会，凯莉

315
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:04,451
对不起，我只是…有点震惊

316
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,218
还有困惑，她是谁？

317
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,861
我本来想打给你

318
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:18,402
她是…
她是我在巴黎认识的女孩

319
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:21,732
她在欧洲替劳夫罗伦工作

320
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,034
所以你只是
从巴黎回来度周末？

321
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,111
不是

322
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,781
巴黎的计划已经告吹

323
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:34,714
我…我有打算跟你联络

324
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,753
我真的不想
在这种情况下遇见你

325
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:44,191
世事难料
我的男伴也在这里…某个地方

326
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,796
他是布莱德米哥医生

327
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:52,266
他擅长理论，或许跟
娜塔莎一样，好看、温柔…

328
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,266
她到底几岁？

329
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:01,211
我不知道，26、27

330
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,148
大概吧

331
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:10,081
我们在汉普顿或回纽约时再见

332
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:13,816
我保证回城里一定打电话给你

333
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:29,131
凯莉，你还好吧？

334
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:33,242
不好，我刚碰到大人物了

335
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:37,404
他从巴黎回来
交了新的女朋友

336
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,918
她26岁

337
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,281
他在哪里？我没看见他

338
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:03,340
我这才明白
二十多岁的女孩确实很迷人

339
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:07,638
直到你看到她身边
有个曾令你心碎的男人
