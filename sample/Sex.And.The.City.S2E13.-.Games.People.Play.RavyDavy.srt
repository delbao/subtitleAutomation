1
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,739
In a town where everyone's dying
to couple up...

2
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,286
...sometimes there's nothing better
than being out of a relationship.

3
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,455
You have time to do your laundry...

4
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,491
...freedom to play your favorite
bad music really loudly.

5
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,050
But the best part of being
out of a relationship:

6
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,528
Plenty of time to catch up
with your friends.

7
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:09,057
I feel sorry for Big.
I really do, because if you think about it...

8
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:12,901
...I was the best thing that ever happened
to him. Actually, I pity him.

9
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:16,669
Because I get to walk away and be me
and he has to walk away and stay him.

10
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,711
Who wants to be him
when you can be me?

11
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,370
I'm smart. I'm funny.

12
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:25,441
I was this thing. I was it.
I was this magic moment.

13
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,815
I was the abracadabra.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,616
I was totally the "poof" in the relationship.

15
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,717
I've got more poof than he could ever have.

16
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,454
Sometimes, I poof just hailing a cab.

17
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,191
So, I guess it's better to know now
so I can go poof someone else.

18
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,755
Someone who deserves me...

19
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:44,531
...and not some screwed up, insecure guy
who can't deal with a woman...

20
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,162
...who's got her act together.

21
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:50,208
Now, I'm gonna end up deliriously happy
and Big is gonna die old and alone...

22
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,074
...and I pity him. Really, I pity him.

23
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,377
What?

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,285
Who's gonna tell her?

25
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,756
What?

26
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,623
You're obsessed with talking about Big
and frankly, we can't take it anymore.

27
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,162
- It's out of our league.
- Is this an intervention?

28
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,858
Yes, stop her before she obsesses again.

29
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:17,232
Isn't part of the breaking up process that
you get free rein to whine to your friends?

30
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,497
Of course you do.

31
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,369
But maybe you should think
about whining to a shrink.

32
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,101
Why should I pay someone
when we can talk for free...

33
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,042
...and then get a drink or whatever?

34
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,842
I don't need professional help.
I've got you guys.

35
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,506
For another ten minutes.

36
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,744
Then we're cutting you off, cold turkey.

37
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,211
Hey, I don't need therapy.
I need new friends.

38
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:40,623
Look, we're as fucked up as you are.
It's like the blind leading the blind.

39
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,628
Sometimes it helps
to talk to somebody who's objective.

40
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,530
Okay, I understand why you see a shrink
because you're always in your head...

41
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,759
...but I'm fine.

42
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,828
I am functioning. Besides, I don't really...

43
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,773
To be honest,
I just don't buy the whole shrink thing.

44
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,867
Neither do I. My parents believe...

45
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,946
...that any head problem can be solved
with physical exercise.

46
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,778
That's why all of us
are really good tennis players.

47
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,881
It's a slippery slope.

48
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,477
First you go once a week,
then three times a week...

49
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,112
...and next thing you know...

50
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,589
...you start sentences, "My shrink says..."

51
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,752
My shrink says that's a very common fear.

52
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:19,188
Therapy is just so self-indulgent.

53
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,499
Ancient man didn't need shrinks to survive.

54
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,628
Ancient man only lived till 30.

55
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,333
Were my friends right?

56
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,874
Had I crossed the line
from pleasantly neurotic...

57
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,534
...into annoyingly troubled?

58
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,135
I decided to seek
my own professional help.

59
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,473
How can you not have a shrink?

60
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,107
This is Manhattan.
Even the shrinks have shrinks.

61
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,015
The fact was, Stanford was right.

62
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,112
The therapist was as ubiquitous
in Manhattan as pirated cable.

63
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,281
I have three.

64
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,482
You do not.

65
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,559
I do:

66
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,490
One when I want to be cuddled...

67
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,256
...one when I want tough love...

68
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,493
...and one for when I just want to look at
a really beautiful man.

69
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,558
- That's sick.
- Which is why I see the other two.

70
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:00,003
- Do you want a name?
- No, Miranda's shrink referred me to one.

71
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,507
Dr. Ellen Greenfield.

72
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,136
Dr. G! My god! She is hot, hot, hot.

73
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,645
Gwyneth Paltrow sees her.

74
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,204
Why does she go to a shrink?

75
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,944
She suffers from high self-esteem.

76
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:17,582
While I was contemplating the couch,
Miranda was enjoying hers.

77
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,576
Two nights later,
she had another nocturnal rendezvous.

78
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:50,353
Soon, Miranda found herself
with a nightly playmate.

79
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,823
A week later, I kept my date with Dr. G,
celebrity shrink.

80
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,160
So Carrie, tell me why you're here.

81
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,932
Well, my friends can't handle me anymore.

82
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,467
You're like very expensive foster care.

83
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,206
What's bothering them?

84
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:15,137
They tell me that I talk
about my ex-boyfriend too much.

85
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,715
But that's normal, right, after a break up?

86
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,845
I don't like the term "normal."

87
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,356
No, of course you don't,
because you wouldn't have any patients.

88
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,018
So, tell me about him:

89
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:28,986
The ex.

90
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,928
You know, I have to be honest.

91
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,903
I'm not sure I really believe in therapy.

92
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,271
I'm more of a
"solve your own problems" kind of gal.

93
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,179
Okay.

94
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,818
I don't know.

95
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,252
He was smart.

96
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,893
He was sexy, just totally screwed up.

97
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:13,370
He was playing all these games,
and I didn't know the rules.

98
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,770
You were playing games.

99
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,436
No, he was. I was just along for the ride.

100
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,837
What about you?

101
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,946
Was this the first time you dated a man
who couldn't give you what you wanted?

102
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,313
Well, that's a little easy, don't you think?

103
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,260
Okay.

104
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,057
Yeah.

105
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,724
Maybe I've dated men
who were wrong for me, but who hasn't?

106
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,962
The thing they have in common is you.

107
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,272
- What's your point?
- Maybe you are picking the wrong men.

108
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,172
Well, of course you pick the wrong guys.
Jesus, I could have told you that.

109
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,377
Frankly, I think I picked
the wrong therapist.

110
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:04,815
She just did not get me at all.
She thought I was a game player.

111
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,484
You have to be.
It's the only way to deal with men.

112
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,619
That's healthy.
Relationships are not about games.

113
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,699
They're about mature
and honest communication.

114
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,530
This from a woman who plays peek-a-boo
with her neighbor.

115
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,001
Games are empowering.

116
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,335
If you know what you're doing,
you can control the situation.

117
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,138
The only place you can control a man
is in bed.

118
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:28,236
If we perpetually gave men blow jobs,
we could run the world.

119
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,544
At least our hands would be
free to greet dignitaries and stuff.

120
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,777
Sorry.

121
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,581
I mean, even if you're in a relationship...

122
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,747
...you still have to play games.

123
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,087
Big and I played games.
Look where it got us.

124
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,186
But maybe the game is not really over.
Maybe it's just halftime.

125
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,332
That kind of delusional thinking
is why you should be in therapy, too.

126
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,767
I do not pick the wrong guys.
They pick me.

127
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,963
So what, you're like a fly strip
for dysfunctional men?

128
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:59,037
Yeah, but one of those really
pretty floral scented ones.

129
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,240
It's slim pickings out there.

130
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,045
You can't swing a Fendi purse
without knocking over five losers.

131
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,747
Where did all the great guys go?

132
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,660
There it was:
Happy hour in the valley of lost men.

133
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,126
Hello.

134
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,289
I've never seen this many of them
rounded up in one space.

135
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,061
- What's going on?
- It's sports night.

136
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,499
It certainly is.

137
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,402
Come on, girls. Let the games begin.

138
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,375
Sports night: Every female's fantasy...

139
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,468
...a room full of captive heterosexual men...

140
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,845
...all looking to be distracted
during commercial breaks.

141
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,511
I'm getting a contact high
from all the testosterone.

142
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,817
- We didn't order these.
- They're on the house.

143
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,414
It's sports night. Ladies drink for free.

144
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,221
Forget Disneyland.
This is the happiest place on Earth.

145
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,491
Yes, indeed.

146
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,328
If you ladies will excuse me.

147
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,366
I'm getting on the bench.

148
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,078
- Who's winning?
- Knicks.

149
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:14,111
- Is that good?
- You're not a Knicks fan, I take it.

150
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,746
Not yet.

151
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,721
- I'm Don.
- Samantha.

152
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,624
Don Seglar was a very successful importer
of Mexican handbags.

153
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:26,631
He was fanatical about two things:
Keeping the price of foreign labor down...

154
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,824
...and the Knicks.

155
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,267
- Maybe I can teach you a few things.
- And vice versa!

156
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,504
It's 10 seconds left.
Pass, you motherfucker!

157
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,635
We need to penetrate, drive to the basket.

158
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,704
Get it to Johnson. He's on fire tonight.
Go L.J., go!

159
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:46,243
Go! Score!

160
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:52,046
Which is exactly
what Samantha did two hours later.

161
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,134
When I got home that night, I couldn't get
charlotte's words out of my head.

162
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,735
We spent our childhoods playing games.

163
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,103
Were they all just primers
for the games we played as adults?

164
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:13,339
Were relationships just a big chess match:
Strategy moves, countermoves...

165
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,973
...all designed to keep your opponent
off balance until you win?

166
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,109
Was there such a thing as
an honest relationship?

167
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,777
Or was it true?

168
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,446
Do you have to play games to
make a relationship work?

169
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,354
I went out with this girl on Saturday night.
We had a great time.

170
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,693
I didn't call her again until Thursday,
so I didn't seem eager.

171
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,865
I went out with this guy on Saturday night.
I thought we had a great time.

172
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,403
The asshole doesn't call me until Thursday.

173
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,066
I screened his call
and didn't return it until Monday.

174
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,037
I gave my boyfriend an ultimatum.
Propose by Christmas or it's over.

175
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,477
My girlfriends said that was a game.
I think it was just smart.

176
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,450
Besides, if he doesn't come through,
I can always secretly get pregnant.

177
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:58,247
The next day, I reluctantly showed up
for my second appointment with Dr. G.

178
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,191
I was still a skeptic and I'd already read
every New Yorker in the waiting room.

179
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,355
When you think about it,
what was I getting out of this anyway?

180
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,666
And then, at five minutes
to my last scheduled hour...

181
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,203
...I got my answer.

182
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,203
My third appointment with Dr. G:

183
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,375
I had come a little early
to catch up on my reading.

184
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,983
Hi. I'm Seth.

185
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,796
Hi. Carrie.

186
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:43,731
I thought we could go on playing
this coy game, or I could introduce myself.

187
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,131
Well, I'm glad you did.

188
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,339
Especially since I had worn
my new dress for the occasion.

189
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,434
That New Yorker is from last year.

190
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:57,441
Well, this New Yorker is
a little behind on her reading.

191
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,644
So, how long you been a Dr. G convert?

192
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,881
Not very long, just three sessions.

193
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,757
I just had my one-year anniversary.

194
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,119
What'd she give you, a cake or something?

195
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,520
A really big bill.

196
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,056
Listen, this is gonna sound a little weird.

197
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,095
Would you have dinner with me sometime?

198
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,004
Sure.

199
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,768
I'd like that.

200
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,439
- Call me, all right?
- Okay.

201
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,147
Maybe it was unethical making a date...

202
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,552
...with Seth Robinson, photographer,
in my shrink's waiting room...

203
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,983
...but there was something about him.

204
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,048
Come on in.

205
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,029
Well, you're dressed up.

206
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,696
He's a photographer.

207
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:53,070
- And you met him at your shrink's?
- It wasn't a setup or anything.

208
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,230
Jeez, what if he's crazy?

209
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,105
It's the crazy ones that have the good pills.

210
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,112
That's it! Go, Marcus! Go!

211
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,444
Excuse me,
but why is that on and who is Marcus?

212
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,076
Marcus Camby, Knicks forward.

213
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,849
Now that Ewing is injured,
he needs to pull it out.

214
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,082
When did we start caring about basketball?

215
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,690
Don is obsessed.
I don't get laid unless the Knicks win.

216
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:17,854
Can I just say?

217
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,626
They and I have been
on a very long losing streak.

218
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,291
- That's awful.
- No kidding.

219
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,928
The Knicks are the only ones
getting screwed.

220
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,995
Come on, you fuckers!

221
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,697
Why are you staying with him?

222
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:33,768
Because the sex, what I can remember,
was unbelievable.

223
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,012
Yes!

224
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,016
They won!

225
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,587
- I've got to go.
- Go.

226
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,849
Have sex. Go!

227
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,491
The next night,
Miranda got a pleasant surprise.

228
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:02,533
Her date thought it was time they moved
past peek-a-boo to playing doctor.

229
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:20,357
Miranda wanted to play fair,
so she gave him a little tit for tat.

230
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,625
All over town, people were getting lucky.

231
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,756
Seth and I were having
a great first date at the coffee shop.

232
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,063
And what about the plant?

233
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,762
I know.
She always has it in a different place.

234
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,501
Maybe it's some sort of
Dr. G psychological test.

235
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,907
- That's it. It's Where's Waldo.
- Yeah.

236
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,942
And it needs to be watered.

237
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,311
- It's plastic.
- Are you sure?

238
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,941
I touched it.

239
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,881
You touched Dr. G's plant?

240
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,355
I've been going to her over a year.
I got bored.

241
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,157
Then you came along.

242
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,260
- Well, that's sweet.
- No, it's true.

243
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,301
There was something about him. I felt
like I could talk to him about anything.

244
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,100
And in the spirit of psychological health
and not playing games...

245
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,868
...I decided to be honest.

246
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,035
I like you.

247
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,737
I like you, too.

248
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,852
Later that week,
Miranda went shopping for dinner.

249
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,835
Shopping quickly devolved
into a game of hide and seek.

250
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,528
I thought I'd be an adult here
and come over and introduce myself.

251
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,922
Hi.

252
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,357
I'm Miranda.

253
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,690
You know.

254
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,666
Across the airshaft.

255
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:21,275
Yeah, right. You're the girl who lives
above the guy I've been cruising.

256
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,811
Miranda realized she was still playing
with an imaginary friend...

257
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,218
...just like she did when she was five.

258
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,622
The next day, she called her shrink
for an emergency session.

259
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,428
Meanwhile, Sam had decided
she would celebrate...

260
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,795
...the end of the basketball season
and the return of her sex life...

261
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,233
...by watching
the final Knicks game at Don's.

262
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,469
Baby!

263
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,069
In a minute, baby.

264
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,705
The Mets are playing Chicago.

265
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:00,716
Now that basketball is over,
I can give them my full attention.

266
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,911
They've been playing lousy ball this year.

267
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,817
The idea of lasting
through another sexless season...

268
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,190
...was more than Samantha could take.

269
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,024
So, she forfeited the game.

270
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,126
Meanwhile, I was getting plenty of action.

271
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,432
Seth and I had just come back
from another amazing date.

272
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,567
You want to come in?

273
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,711
I think I already am.

274
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,639
This is great.

275
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:38,846
You have all the classics here:
Clue, Parcheesi, and Twister.

276
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,818
I was the seventh grade Twister champion.

277
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,089
- Is that a challenge?
- Yeah.

278
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,292
All right, buddy. It's go time.

279
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:15,616
- How are you holding up?
- Feeling good, my friend.

280
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,227
Left foot yellow.

281
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,260
I guess that one's mine.

282
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,860
You're in a very compromising position.

283
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,838
I believe I'm in about
20 compromising positions.

284
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,170
I am not gonna lose my concentration.

285
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,325
In no time it was "yellow pants off."

286
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,094
So what do you think Dr. G
would have to say about this?

287
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,162
Very bad.

288
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,395
Bad patients.

289
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,466
I have to tell you.

290
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,233
I'm not really into therapy,
I think it's kind of bullshit.

291
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,081
- I'm telling Dr. G on you.
- No, no!

292
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,610
- Cross your heart.
- Hope to die.

293
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,189
So why are you in therapy, seriously?

294
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,691
I'm really fucked up about women.

295
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,956
After I sleep with them,
I completely lose interest.

296
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,691
What about you? What's your problem?

297
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:34,602
I believe in therapy,
this moment is called "the breakthrough."

298
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,135
I pick the wrong men.

299
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:54,652
Although she'd made some good points,
I stopped seeing Dr. G immediately.

300
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,954
I couldn't risk the humiliation
of running into Seth in the waiting room.

301
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,656
My friends totally understand.

1
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,968
欲望城市

2
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:38,070
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧）

3
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,477
“游戏人间”

4
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,575
在一个人人都渴望
找个伴的城市中

5
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:54,220
有时没甚么比从一段感情中
脱身更好的事

6
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,150
你有空洗衣服

7
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,291
把最棒的音乐
开得震天嘎响的自由

8
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:04,293
但最棒的还是
有许多时间和朋友叙旧

9
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,557
我为大人物难过

10
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,895
我是他交往过最好的对象

11
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:16,439
我同情他，我可以离开做自己
而他还是老样子

12
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:20,238
谁想跟他一样？
我既聪明又风趣

13
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,177
我是完美的女人，独一无二

14
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,580
我是不可思议的一刻
就像咒语

15
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,619
我为这段感情注入魔力

16
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:33,259
我一根手指的魔力
比他全身上下加起来还多

17
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,291
有时我手一挥便能拦到计程车

18
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:39,090
现在知道了也好
这样我才能对别人施展魔力

19
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,030
吸引一个值得我爱的人
不是某个自大没安全感的家伙

20
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,067
无法应付一个沉稳自信的女人

21
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,140
我会一辈子幸福快乐
而大人物将会孤独终老

22
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,506
我可怜他，真的

23
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,213
-怎么了？
-好，谁要跟她说？

24
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,821
甚么？

25
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:07,515
你满嘴谈的都是大人物
我们再也受不了了

26
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,661
我们根本插不上话

27
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:12,796
-这算是干涉吗？
-没错，别再想著他了

28
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,990
随时和朋友诉苦

29
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,260
不是分手过程中的一部分吗？

30
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,493
当然

31
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,306
也许你该考虑
去和心理医生吐苦水

32
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:25,945
我们可以免费聊天，喝杯东西
何必付钱给别人？

33
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,808
我不需要专业的协助
我有你们这些姊妹

34
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,678
-再给你十分钟
-然后我们便会打断你

35
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:36,652
我不需要心理治疗
我需要新朋友

36
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,485
我们和你一样失败
就像盲人瞎马，只会引入危途

37
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,129
有时和客观的人谈谈会有帮助

38
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,127
我了解你们为何去看心理医生

39
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:51,395
你们总是钻牛角尖
但我好得很，一切运作正常

40
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:56,632
此外，老实说
我不信心理医生那一套

41
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,935
我父母相信任何脑部毛病

42
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,113
可以藉著运动解决

43
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,477
这就是为甚么
我们都很擅长打网球

44
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,620
这会让人越陷越深，刚开始
一周去一次，接著一周去三次

45
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:12,518
突然间你开口闭口都是
「我的心理医生说…」

46
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:19,460
-我心理医生说那恐惧很平常
-心理治疗实在有些自我放纵

47
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,362
古人不靠心理医生也活得下去

48
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:26,470
-古人只活到30岁
-我的朋友们说对了吗？

49
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,439
我已从讨人喜欢的神经质
跨越到惹人厌的烦躁吗？

50
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,077
我寻求自己的专业协助

51
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,372
你没有心理医生？

52
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,880
在曼哈顿
连心理医生自己都有心理医生

53
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:42,953
史丹佛说得对，治疗师
和偷接的第四台一样无所不在

54
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,454
-我就有三个
-才怪

55
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,252
我真的有
一个是当我需要温柔拥抱时

56
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,019
一个是当我想要严厉教训时

57
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,165
还有一个是当我想欣赏
潇洒美男子时

58
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,358
-你真变态
-所以我才要看其他两个

59
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:00,471
-需要我推荐吗？
-米兰达帮我介绍了一个

60
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,436
艾伦葛林菲尔医生

61
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:07,670
葛医生？我的天，她超热门
葛妮斯派特洛也找她

62
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,873
-她为甚么看心理医生？
-她饱受自视过高之苦

63
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:17,822
当我思量是否要接受心理治疗
米兰达舒服地坐在沙发上

64
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:40,442
两天后
她有了另一次深夜偶遇

65
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,721
不久，米兰达为自己找到一个
夜间的玩伴

66
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,587
一周后，我如期去看
名流心理医生…葛大夫

67
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,458
凯莉，告诉我你为甚么来这里

68
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:04,103
我的朋友们受不了我

69
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,397
你就像非常昂贵的寄养中心

70
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,972
甚么事困扰她们？

71
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:15,136
她们说我讲太多前男友的事

72
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,215
但分手之后那是正常现象吧？

73
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,478
-我不喜欢「正常」这个字眼
-那当然

74
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,919
这样一来你就没有病人了

75
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,924
跟我谈谈他，前男友

76
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,199
你知道…

77
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,569
我得对你坦白

78
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:42,734
我不确定是否真相信心理治疗

79
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:48,639
我比较算是自力救济型的人

80
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,987
好吧

81
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,115
我不知道

82
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,256
他很聪明

83
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:09,194
他很性感，只是心态不正常

84
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:13,428
他一直在玩游戏
但我却不知道规则

85
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,971
-你们一直在玩游戏？
-不，是他在玩

86
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,736
-我只是奉陪下场
-那你呢？

87
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,141
这是你第一次跟一个

88
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:26,148
不能满足你需求的
男人交往吗？

89
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,578
这问得倒轻松

90
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,284
好吧…

91
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:40,625
也许我曾跟不适合我的人交往
可是谁没有呢？

92
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:45,395
但他们的共同点…是你

93
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:50,200
-你想说甚么？
-也许你挑错男人了

94
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:56,004
你当然挑错男人了
这种话我也会讲

95
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,912
坦白说
我想我挑错心理医生了

96
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,986
她一点也不了解我

97
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:07,455
-她以为我是游戏人间的高手
-这是对付男人的唯一办法

98
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,595
这种心态还真健康
感情无关游戏

99
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,595
而是成熟、真诚的沟通

100
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,428
你却跟邻居大玩躲猫猫

101
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:21,129
如果你知道自己在做甚么
你就能完全控制局势

102
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,070
你只能在床上控制男人

103
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,213
若我们不断替男人口交
我们便能统治世界

104
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,542
至少我们还能空出双手
跟达官贵人打招呼

105
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,620
就算是交往中，你仍得玩游戏

106
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,815
大人物和我就是在玩游戏
看看我们的下场

107
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:44,190
也许游戏还没真正结束
也许只是中场休息

108
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:48,197
有那种错误想法就是你为何
该接受心理治疗的原因

109
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,528
我没有挑错男朋友
是他们找上我

110
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,207
你就像专门吸引
缺陷男人的磁铁？

111
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,935
而且还是漂亮
有花样和香味的那种

112
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,170
找到好男人的机会渺茫

113
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,976
连甩个名牌皮包
都会打到五个蹩脚货

114
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,018
好男人都到哪儿去了？

115
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,958
就是这里
失落男人谷的快乐时光

116
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,221
我没看过这么多男人
同时聚集在一个地方

117
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,832
-这是怎么回事？
-今晚是运动之夜

118
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:27,199
肯定是
来吧，姊妹们，比赛开打了

119
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,375
运动之夜，每个女人的梦想

120
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,409
整个房间都是
专注球赛的异性恋男子

121
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,878
等著在广告时段分心

122
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:41,110
这里充斥的睾丸酮
让我跃跃欲试

123
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:46,248
-我们没点这些
-运动之夜，女士饮料免费

124
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,156
忘了迪士尼乐园吧
这里才是世上最欢乐的地方

125
00:08:55,601 --> 00:09:00,300
姊妹们，容我失陪…
我要上场了

126
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,081
-哪一队领先？
-尼克队

127
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,444
那是好事吗？

128
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,712
-我猜你不是尼克队球迷
-还不是

129
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,620
-我叫唐
-我叫莎曼珊

130
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:22,555
唐是一个成功的
墨西哥手提包进口商

131
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,753
他对两件事著迷

132
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,524
压抑外劳工资以及尼克队

133
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,533
-我可以教你几件事
-或者由我来教你

134
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,263
还剩十秒钟
快传球，你这白痴

135
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,442
得把球送到篮下

136
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,336
强森今晚火力全开

137
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,812
加油，拉瑞强森，快得分

138
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,746
得分

139
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:52,551
这正是莎曼珊两小时后的写照

140
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:03,092
我回到家后
夏绿蒂的话在我脑中萦绕不去

141
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,668
我们在童年玩的游戏

142
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,965
是成年后所玩游戏的入门吗？

143
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,176
男女交往
是否只是一盘西洋棋局？

144
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,311
策略、步法、反制

145
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,879
全都设计好让对手失去优势
直到赢得比赛为止？

146
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,747
究竟有没有诚实的男女关系？
这是真的吗？

147
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,412
玩游戏是感情的成功之本？

148
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,152
礼拜六我和一个女生约会
我们相处得很愉快

149
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,889
我到了礼拜四才打电话给她
这样便不会显得猴急

150
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,694
礼拜六我和一个男生约会
我们相处得很愉快

151
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,234
这混蛋到了礼拜四才打给我

152
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,236
我过滤他的电话
而且直到礼拜一才回电

153
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,933
我给男友下了最后通牒
圣诞节前求婚，否则便分手

154
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,376
我的朋友说这是在耍手段
我认为这招很聪明

155
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,313
就算他不肯就范
我还是可以偷偷怀孕

156
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,252
隔天，我勉强赴葛医生
第二次约诊

157
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:02,018
我仍对此心存怀疑
在候诊室内读每本「纽约客」

158
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,527
我到底能从中获得甚么？

159
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:10,100
然后，在五分钟的间隔时间里
我得到了答案

160
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,198
嗨

161
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,237
嗨

162
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,075
我和葛医生的第三次约诊

163
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,272
我提早到了一些…
以赶上我的阅读进度

164
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,884
我叫赛斯

165
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,659
我是凯莉

166
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,593
我想我应该来自我介绍

167
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,304
很高兴你这么做

168
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,270
尤其是我穿了新洋装

169
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,671
那本「纽约客」是去年的

170
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:57,315
我这个纽约客
阅读进度有点落后了

171
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,648
你追随葛医生多久了？

172
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,879
不久，才三次

173
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,655
我今天正好过一周年纪念

174
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:10,351
-她送你甚么？蛋糕？
-一大笔帐单

175
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:19,404
这听起来可能很怪
你愿意和我吃晚餐吗？

176
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,664
当然，我很乐意

177
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,338
打电话给我，好吗？

178
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,576
或许在心理医生的候诊室内
和摄影师赛斯罗宾森

179
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:38,848
敲定约会是不道德的
但他有特殊之处

180
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,552
请进，凯莉

181
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,390
你打扮得好隆重

182
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,532
他是个摄影师

183
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:53,164
-你在心理医生那里认识的？
-这一切皆是偶然

184
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,032
万一他是疯子怎么办？

185
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,005
疯子才有好药方

186
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:02,510
就是这样，上，马克斯

187
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,445
抱歉，为甚么看这个
还有谁是马克斯？

188
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,644
马克斯坎比，尼克队前锋
他真的有所表现了

189
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,222
你甚么时候开始关心篮球？

190
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,588
唐走火入魔，除非尼克队赢球
不然他不跟我上床

191
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,527
而他们和我可说是节节败退

192
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,325
真惨

193
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,729
尼克队是唯一被「操」的

194
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,565
-上，你们这群软脚虾
-你为甚么还要跟他在一起？

195
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,973
因为性生活…
就我记忆所及，实在妙不可言

196
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,082
太好了…他们赢了

197
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:44,587
-他们赢了，我走了
-去吧…去做爱吧

198
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,318
隔天晚上
米兰达获得意外惊喜

199
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,135
她的玩伴认为不该再玩躲猫猫

200
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,830
而是玩医生看病的游戏

201
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:20,450
米兰达希望公平
所以她决定礼尚往来

202
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,453
整个城市的人都很幸运

203
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:27,632
赛斯和我的初次约会棒极了

204
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:32,736
-那盆栽是怎么回事？
-她总是不停变换位置

205
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:36,430
也许这是葛医生的心理测验

206
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,839
-没错，像「瓦多在哪里？」
-而且还需要浇水

207
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,212
-它是塑胶花
-你确定吗？

208
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,476
我摸过了

209
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,813
你摸葛医生的盆栽？

210
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,185
我已经去了一年，难免会无聊

211
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:59,527
-然后你出现了
-你真会说话

212
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,222
不，是真的

213
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,199
我觉得我可以跟他谈任何事

214
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:09,100
为了心理健康并且不再玩游戏

215
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,832
我决定诚实相告

216
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:15,208
-我喜欢你
-我也喜欢你

217
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,355
过了几天，米兰达去采买晚餐

218
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,737
采买随即变成了捉迷藏的游戏

219
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:04,656
我想我该成熟点过来自我介绍

220
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,601
我是米兰达，你知道的…

221
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,740
通风口对面的

222
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:21,674
对了，你住在
跟我调情的男人楼上

223
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,711
米兰达这才明白
她仍在和想像中的朋友玩游戏

224
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,116
就跟她五岁时一样

225
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,486
隔天她联络心理医生
预约紧急治疗

226
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:38,588
莎曼珊决定在唐家
观赏尼克队的决赛

227
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,594
庆祝篮球的球季进入尾声

228
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,257
恢复性生活

229
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,141
宝贝，再等一下
大都会队和白袜队就要开打了

230
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,716
现在篮球结束了
我可以专心看棒球

231
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,514
今年他们战绩烂透了

232
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,749
想到要再撑一整季的无性生活

233
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,227
已非莎曼珊能容忍
因此她弃权了

234
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,129
同时，我的进展也很精彩

235
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,306
赛斯和我
从另一次美好的约会返家

236
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,569
-你想进来吗？
-我想我已经进来了

237
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,274
你的公寓真不错

238
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:38,747
你有各种经典游戏
巴棋戏…还有扭扭乐

239
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,718
我是七年级的扭扭乐冠军

240
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,920
这是在下战书吗？

241
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,122
好，那就开始吧

242
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:16,053
-你还行吗？
-吾友，好得很…

243
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,128
左脚黄色

244
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,028
我想那块是我的

245
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,759
你这种姿势很不雅

246
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:30,441
我可以做出20种不雅的姿势

247
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,141
我不要分心

248
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,421
很快便成了宽衣游戏

249
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,654
你想葛医生会怎么说？

250
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,858
不乖，坏透了的病人

251
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:06,335
我得告诉你，我不是很相信
心理治疗，我觉得是鬼扯

252
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,141
我要跟葛医生说

253
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,215
不要…

254
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:14,247
-你发誓？
-我发誓

255
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,191
说真的
你为甚么看心理医生？

256
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,660
我对女人有心理障碍

257
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:28,390
我跟她们上床之后
就会完全失去兴趣

258
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,602
你呢？你有甚么问题？

259
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,465
我想在心理治疗中
这一刻可称之为突破

260
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,308
我总是挑错男人

261
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,689
虽然她说对了一些事
我决定从此不再去上门

262
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:58,886
我不想冒著
在候诊室撞见赛斯的尴尬风险

263
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,827
我的朋友们完全能了解
