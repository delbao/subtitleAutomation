00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:03,612
A few months ago, I
discovered I had a twin sister.

2
00:00:03,646 --> 00:00:05,513
And then she she asked
me to take her place,

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:07,855
keep the secret, find our real mother

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,970
and try to stay alive.

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:11,606
Put yourself in my shoes.

6
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:15,374
How long could you keep up the lying game?

7
00:00:15,408 --> 00:00:16,729
- I'm not interested.
- Oh, is that right?

8
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:22,469
You said it was fine, so I slept with him.

9
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:24,366
It was a mistake, Sutton.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,395
Ted, about the therapy session on Monday,

11
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,627
I'll be there.

12
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,462
I'm so happy for you.

13
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,560
What's going on here?

14
00:00:30,594 --> 00:00:31,692
I was just thanking her

15
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:34,289
- for tutoring me.
- You know what?

16
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:35,454
It doesn't matter.

17
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:36,554
Care to make things interesting?

18
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:38,287
You want to switch back?

19
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:40,623
Whoever loses has to stay in the cabin.

20
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:42,357
That phone I found exonerated him.

21
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:44,458
I can't beat him. The only
mistake I made was taking

22
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:45,591
your bastard ass in.

23
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,323
Hey, hey!

24
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:48,421
There is nothing left for me here anymore.

25
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:49,552
What about me?

26
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:51,350
Tough break, but a deal's a deal.

27
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,717
I left some clean towels
for you at the cabin.

28
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,317
I've gotten the feeling that he might

29
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:57,386
blame me for his arrest.

30
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,387
Hey, baby, I'm home.

31
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,423
Good morning, sunshine.

32
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,758
Uh, what are you doing?

33
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:20,859
Just watching you sleep.

34
00:01:20,893 --> 00:01:22,394
I missed that.

35
00:01:22,428 --> 00:01:23,595
Well, isn't that romantic?

36
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:25,829
I've been in prison for a while.

37
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:27,731
I can't believe I'm actually here with you.

38
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:31,735
Well...

39
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:36,770
was it worth the wait?

40
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,506
You tell me.

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,708
So, your first day as a free man.

42
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:42,776
What are your plans?

43
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:47,546
I was thinking maybe we could take that

44
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,648
honeymoon we've been putting off.

45
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:54,618
Oh, well, that sounds great, but...

46
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:56,586
where are we gonna go on such short notice?

47
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,787
As it turns out, I got a
little spot I know about.

48
00:01:58,822 --> 00:02:00,589
- A little bed and breakfast?
- Hmm.

49
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:01,757
A five-star resort and spa?

50
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,790
Ah, now, it wouldn't be a surprise

51
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:04,425
if I told you, would it?

52
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,460
Oh, well, come on, just a little hint.

53
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,828
Please tell me.

54
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:13,631
Let's just say that this weekend

55
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:17,434
my bride finally gets
everything she deserves.

56
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:21,604
Finally.

57
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,849
This is Thayer.

58
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:39,550
You know what to do.

59
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:42,453
Hey, it's me again.

60
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:45,788
answer, so I'm trying you here.
I tried your cell and you didn't

61
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:47,456
that you're okay. I just want to know

62
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,391
I hate the way we left things.

63
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:50,625
Please call me.

64
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:57,496
Thayer?

65
00:02:57,531 --> 00:02:59,398
Nope, it's me.

66
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:01,466
I wanted to see how your
night at the cabin was.

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,700
You're checking on me?

68
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,635
Well, of course, you're my sister.

69
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,805
Plus, I know how lonely it can get there.

70
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:10,340
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

71
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,442
But it's just for a few days, right?

72
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:14,476
We're switching back
after tennis regionals.

73
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,477
That was the deal.

74
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:17,778
Anyway, I'm calling

75
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:21,780
because I wanted to make
sure you're not mad at me

76
00:03:21,814 --> 00:03:24,507
for what I told you

77
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,632
the other day about, you know.

78
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,365
About you sleeping with Ethan?

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,599
I told you, it's fine.

80
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:31,699
Really?

81
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:33,633
Yes, sleep with whomever you want.

82
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:36,467
Just promise me you won't do anything

83
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:38,334
to rock the boat with Ted and Kristin.

84
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,534
If you haven't noticed,

85
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:40,534
they're getting along better now.

86
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:41,701
I get it, Emma.

87
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,369
You have my word.

88
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:47,661
And, in fact, I think
you'll find that I am going

89
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:52,413
to be a sweeter, nicer
version of myself than you.

90
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:54,405
Do you have a sec?

91
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,770
You have nothing to
worry about. I have to go.

92
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:57,561
What's up?

93
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:00,685
I wanted to talk to you about
what happened last night.

94
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,513
What happened last night?

95
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:04,605
When I saw Jordan kissing Mads outside?

96
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,330
Oh, right, yeah, that...

97
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:08,395
that was rough.

98
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:09,493
I thought things were going so well

99
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:11,260
between me and Jordan,

100
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,632
and then Mads just totally
goes behind my back...

101
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,264
Okay, look, Laurel.

102
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,531
What you need to remember

103
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:20,562
is that Jordan Lyle is a worldly,

104
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:22,494
older,

105
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,525
dangerously sexy guy

106
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,255
who, let's face it,

107
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,386
is way out of your league.

108
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:35,415
If I remember correctly, uh, the other day,

109
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,413
you said he'd be lucky to have me.

110
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:40,344
And clearly you blew it,

111
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,642
so I think you should move on.

112
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:47,304
I mean, go for some lower
hanging fruit like a sophomore.

113
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,237
Or one of those guys in the clubs

114
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:51,392
in the back of the yearbook.

115
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,496
I... I don't get it.

116
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:58,460
I know, I know.

117
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:01,355
Love... it's very confusing.

118
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,215
I'm hungry for breakfast, though.

119
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:06,244
I'm thinking tofu scramble?

120
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:16,236
- synced and corrected by chamallow -

121
00:05:31,805 --> 00:05:33,566
Hi, Dad.

122
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,697
What are you doing here?

123
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:35,696
Hi, kiddo.

124
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,728
Your father has some news.

125
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:38,457
What is it?

126
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:40,486
Well, remember all that
pro bono work I was doing

127
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,584
at the burn clinic last summer?

128
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:43,448
Turns out

129
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:44,580
I was just named

130
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:46,744
Phoenix Surgical Humanitarian of the Year.

131
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,475
That's awesome.

132
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:50,606
Is there, like, some kind
of ceremony or something?

133
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,637
Yeah, the banquet's tomorrow.

134
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:53,333
Originally I was gonna go myself,

135
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:54,648
but then, since they're giving me

136
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,496
this award, I was kind of hoping...

137
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,294
Well, of course, we'll be there.

138
00:05:58,328 --> 00:05:59,626
There's one more thing.

139
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:03,489
They usually ask the
recipient's significant other

140
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:05,654
to say a few words before the presentation.

141
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,418
So I guess the committee
doesn't know about our situation?

142
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,484
Actually, I was going to mention it,

143
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:10,516
but then I thought things were going

144
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,381
pretty well between us, so...

145
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:18,208
I know it's a lot to spring on you.

146
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:20,306
Maybe we can discuss it
during family therapy tomorrow.

147
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:21,405
Maybe.

148
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,336
Great. I'll see you then.

149
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:25,401
Bye.

150
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:26,500
Bye, Dad.

151
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:27,533
Bye, hon.

152
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:28,599
Bye.

153
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,528
Well, that was awkward.

154
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,425
We are going, right, Mom?

155
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,257
Of course, of course.

156
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,255
But, I mean, for me to
be giving a speech is...

157
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:41,219
Mom, please, it would mean so much to him.

158
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:42,418
And you guys have been doing better.

159
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,216
Well, yes, in the sense

160
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:47,246
that we can be in the
same room without fighting.

161
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,378
But for me to stand up
in front of an audience

162
00:06:49,412 --> 00:06:51,309
and pretend that we're a happy couple...

163
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,475
No, why don't Laurel and I do it?

164
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,574
Really?

165
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:56,472
Mm-hmm.

166
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:58,270
I mean, sure, yeah, we can do it.

167
00:06:58,304 --> 00:06:59,385
Sweetie, it's short notice.

168
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:01,167
Do you have time to prepare a speech?

169
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,565
For a bunch of nerdy doctors? Yeah.

170
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:08,353
Plus, I already know what I'm going to say.

171
00:07:11,575 --> 00:07:13,538
Mads, I wasn't expecting you.

172
00:07:13,573 --> 00:07:15,437
Uh, because I'm not here to see you.

173
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:17,603
Hey, is this about last night?

174
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:18,669
'Cause until Laurel
had her little meltdown,

175
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:19,702
you and I were getting

176
00:07:19,736 --> 00:07:20,734
pretty hot and...

177
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:22,767
I'm not here to discuss that.

178
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:23,836
Okay, why are you here?

179
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:26,642
Maddie?

180
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:27,675
Hi, honey.

181
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,875
Hi.

182
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:29,875
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

183
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:31,473
Me, too.

184
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:32,472
- You good?
- Yes.

185
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:33,671
Mr. Rybak,

186
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:34,771
we didn't get a chance to meet last night.

187
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:36,504
- I'm Jordan Lyle.
- Jordan.

188
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:37,703
- Rebecca's stepson.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:39,435
- You can call me Alec.
- All right.

190
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,801
- I see you two have already met?
- Barely.

191
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:43,795
We've bumped into each
other a couple times, yeah.

192
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,743
Hmm, well, glad you're acquainted.

193
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:49,680
Maddie, since I've moved
in here with Rebecca,

194
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:51,684
I was kind of hoping you might
think about doing the same.

195
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:52,886
Really?

196
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:54,859
That's an interesting idea, sir.

197
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:56,833
We'll see.

198
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:57,936
It's good to see that everybody's

199
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,741
getting to know each other.

200
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:01,880
Honey, did you tell them
about our honeymoon plans?

201
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,686
Honeymoon?

202
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,524
Um, yeah...

203
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:07,461
Sutton?

204
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:09,699
What are you doing here?

205
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,568
Well, the door was open, so...

206
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:12,669
So you just walked in?

207
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:14,670
Well, my godfather

208
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:16,471
is back and

209
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:18,572
I was just so excited to see him.

210
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:22,608
Well, you're kind of
interrupting a family moment.

211
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:24,576
So let me show you out.

212
00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:29,546
Okay, I'm sorry.

213
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,780
I didn't realize I was walking

214
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:33,783
into the Bizarro family reunion back there.

215
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,717
Why are you freaking out?

216
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:36,751
I'm not freaking out.

217
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:38,819
You were being careless.

218
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:40,821
Fine, I screwed up, but I'm
just really excited to tell you

219
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,722
- what happened this morning.
- What?

220
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,591
My dad's getting this award...

221
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,859
- What award?
- I don't know.

222
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,695
I wasn't really listening.

223
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,796
Maybe for giving homeless people
free boob jobs or something?

224
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,897
Anyway,

225
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,600
he asked Kristin to
introduce him at the ceremony.

226
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:55,768
She said no.

227
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:56,903
Guess who offered to speak instead.

228
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,739
- Excellent.
- Mm-hmm, and get this:

229
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:00,642
- we're going to family therapy.
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:03,647
And don't worry, I already
know what I'm going to say.

231
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:06,720
Okay, even so, I want
you to run it by me first.

232
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,657
Our plan is moving to the next phase,

233
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:10,726
and I don't want to
leave anything to chance.

234
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,794
Okay?

235
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:13,728
Call me later.

236
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,730
Okay.

237
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:28,715
Look, if you want to take a break, we...

238
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:29,850
No, let's just keep going.

239
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:31,620
We have a ton of chemistry to do left.

240
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,491
Okay.

241
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,967
Emma, I just want you to
know that I, I appreciate

242
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:40,837
you still tutoring me.

243
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,839
'Cause I know you're probably going

244
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,976
through a lot with Thayer leaving.

245
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,613
Ethan, let's not do this.

246
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,682
What?

247
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:51,984
I'm... I'm just trying to be a friend here.

248
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,789
You're not my friend.

249
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:56,991
And I may be helping you
study here, but I don't want

250
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:59,593
to discuss Thayer any
more than I want to talk

251
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:01,189
about what happened with you and Sutton.

252
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:06,934
Of course.

253
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:10,671
She told you that we slept
together after Jordan's party.

254
00:10:10,705 --> 00:10:12,940
It's not my business.

255
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:14,708
Then, why are you acting like it is?

256
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:21,682
Because I used to think
you were better than that.

257
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,759
What are they doing here?

258
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:35,662
Oh, crap.

259
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:43,084
Alec, I know you wanted to
surprise me, but this place?

260
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:45,119
What are we, hillbillies?

261
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:47,655
Hurry, grab everything. They
can't know we were here. All right.

262
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:51,959
- Is this yours?
- Doesn't matter, just take it.

263
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:55,762
Damn it.

264
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:57,130
Hang on, uh, here, give me a towel, quick.

265
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:58,131
Uh...

266
00:10:58,165 --> 00:11:00,735
Here, take this.

267
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:01,936
Oh, hurry, hurry, hurry.

268
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,705
Your keys.

269
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:04,940
Got it. Got it.

270
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:18,686
What?

271
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:21,088
I'm sorry.

272
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:23,057
I'm a little rusty.

273
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:24,825
- Oh.
- Come here.

274
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,061
I had no idea you were so old-fashioned.

275
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:29,628
Oh, well, there's more
surprises where that came from.

276
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:30,828
That sounds good.

277
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:33,629
Look, flat screen.

278
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:34,897
Are they on their honeymoon?

279
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:36,132
I guess.

280
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,769
Oh, my God, what if
they start getting naked?

281
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:40,804
Ted bought this place

282
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,640
when they were still in diapers.

283
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:44,642
Now you couldn't pay 'em to come up here.

284
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:48,046
Oh, well, I'm sure

285
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,715
I will come to love it.

286
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,752
After all, you brought me
up here for some reason.

287
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:57,091
I'm sure I'll figure out what that is.

288
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,797
Why don't I give you

289
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:03,933
- the grand tour?
- Oh.

290
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:06,735
She saw us.

291
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:07,969
- No, she didn't.
- Yes, she did.

292
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:09,003
She looked right at me.

293
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:10,638
Oh. 

294
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:12,841
Wait, w... wait, slow down, cowboy.

295
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,911
I'm not done with you in this room.

296
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:19,748
We have to go.

297
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:21,650
Let's go. There's a window.

298
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:23,786
Laurel, come on, I want to apologize

299
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,754
for last night, all right? I...

300
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:27,056
I don't want it to be weird between us.

301
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,859
Hmm, think it's late for that, don't you?

302
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:30,661
Well, it doesn't have to be.

303
00:12:30,695 --> 00:12:32,629
When you invited me to
the club the other night,

304
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:34,698
I didn't know that was a
date. All right, that's my bad.

305
00:12:34,732 --> 00:12:37,968
Look, you're very pretty, all right?

306
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:42,072
I'm pretty?

307
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:44,041
Yeah.

308
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:46,711
Okay, look, Jordan, any misguided feelings

309
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:49,781
I might have briefly had
for you are definitely over,

310
00:12:49,815 --> 00:12:52,684
so you can save your
patronizing compliments.

311
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:53,819
That's fair enough.

312
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:54,953
Anything else?

313
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:58,957
All right, let me tell you what.

314
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,025
Let's go grab some breakfast,

315
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,060
and you can yell at me all you want.

316
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,996
What do you say?

317
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,731
I say,

318
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:08,668
have fun kissing your stepsister, creep.

319
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:33,660
Well, I didn't see that one coming.

320
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:35,862
Yeah, Alec honeymooning at the cabin.

321
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:38,766
I kind of figured him for a
Turks and Caicos kind of guy.

322
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,934
You gonna be okay here?

323
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,869
Yeah.

324
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:43,104
This is the hotel that Sutton stayed

325
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:45,640
when her car went into the lake.

326
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,942
You want me to come inside with you?

327
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,977
No.

328
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,979
I'm fine. Thanks.

329
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:55,749
So this means tutoring is out, I guess?

330
00:13:55,783 --> 00:13:58,986
No.

331
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,890
Believe it or not, I don't want
to see you go back to juvie.

332
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,025
So...

333
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,994
just meet me back here later.

334
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:09,799
We'll finish our session.

335
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,968
Hey.

336
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:13,069
Emma?

337
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,639
Thanks.

338
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,050
Hi, I need a room, please.

339
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:29,877
It's you.

340
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,735
I'm sorry?

341
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:33,900
You owe me money.

342
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:38,895
I do owe you money

343
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,860
from the last time I was here.

344
00:14:40,894 --> 00:14:42,691
What was the bill again?

345
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:44,689
You know, this isn't about the bill.

346
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:45,888
I did you a favor.

347
00:14:45,922 --> 00:14:47,852
When that guy came in asking questions,

348
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,781
you paid me to lie and say
you were in that room alone.

349
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:53,636
Right.

350
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,935
Alone, well, I...

351
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,867
I was with that woman.

352
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:58,664
That woman. You mean women.

353
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,795
- What?
- Wow.

354
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:03,791
You really did take a knock
on the head that night.

355
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:06,955
Girly, there were two
women with you in that room.

356
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,887
- Two women?
- Yeah, two.

357
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,485
So, where's my 80 bucks?

358
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:23,283
I got to say, this crappy motel room

359
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:26,320
isn't exactly the ideal
place for studying Faulkner.

360
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:27,655
Yeah.

361
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:29,490
Maybe if we talk louder,

362
00:15:29,524 --> 00:15:32,428
the hookers next door will learn something.

363
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,213
Hey, maybe that's them now.

364
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:43,288
Sutton, what are you doing here?

365
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:45,457
What does it look like I'm doing here?

366
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:47,293
Ethan gave me a little hint

367
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:48,394
about your cram session.

368
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:50,696
So I thought I'd hit the books.

369
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,531
Really?

370
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:54,533
You're here to study?

371
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:59,204
Well, yeah, thanks to you,

372
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,540
Sutton Mercer has a hefty
GPA to maintain, so...

373
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:05,444
and studying is all that's
going on here, right?

374
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:06,578
What do you think?

375
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,214
Anyway, you know,

376
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,485
I figured you'd be pretty
busy working on your speech.

377
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
What speech?

378
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:15,222
Oh, it's nothing.

379
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:16,556
Just some stupid awards thing for my dad.

380
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:21,262
Being here brings back

381
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:22,630
so many memories, which is surprising,

382
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:26,367
considering I had a head
wound last time I was here.

383
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:27,534
Yeah, funny you should say that,

384
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,503
because when I was checking in,

385
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:30,604
the desk clerk said something

386
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:32,305
kind of weird to me.

387
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,653
Well, he's weird.

388
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:35,689
What did he say?

389
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:38,558
He said that when you were here,

390
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:41,628
Annie wasn't the only person with you.

391
00:16:41,662 --> 00:16:43,463
Someone else was here.

392
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:45,465
Did he now?

393
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:50,571
Well, he was so busy
hitting on me that night

394
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:53,740
that he couldn't have possibly
noticed who I was with.

395
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:58,311
Who did he think he saw?

396
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:01,548
He didn't say.

397
00:17:01,582 --> 00:17:03,684
But anyway, you're right.

398
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,285
He...

399
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,253
creeped me out, too.

400
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,658
This is nice.

401
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:14,327
Cloth napkins,

402
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:16,496
candlelight.

403
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,366
Le poulet en croûte.

404
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,467
It's from Celine,

405
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:22,469
your favorite spot.

406
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:25,405
Well, you really did think of everything.

407
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,674
It's a very special wine.

408
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:31,544
I've been saving it for
a very special occasion.

409
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:35,381
I think tonight might just be that night.

410
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:45,425
Let's celebrate like tonight

411
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:47,594
is our last night on Earth.

412
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:54,734
You know, one of the things

413
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,570
we never talked about is what you did

414
00:17:56,604 --> 00:17:59,306
the whole time I was gone.
I mean, that must have been

415
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:02,310
tough for you, having
your new husband locked up.

416
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:03,578
It was.

417
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:05,413
They were the hardest days of my life.

418
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:07,282
I'll bet.

419
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:09,417
Did you ever wonder if I was
ever getting out of there?

420
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:10,719
Now, why would I?

421
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:13,254
You're an innocent man.

422
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,690
I have faith in the system.

423
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:19,260
Although there was this one moment.

424
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:21,596
Oh, it's nothing.

425
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,265
We were both under a lot of stress.

426
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,669
There was this one time that
I went to see you in jail,

427
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:30,472
and... I...

428
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:34,542
could have thought that you...

429
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:36,377
thought that I was somehow...

430
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,448
behind framing you for Derek's murder.

431
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:42,483
That's crazy talk.

432
00:18:42,518 --> 00:18:45,320
And we both know you were my rock,

433
00:18:45,354 --> 00:18:46,755
you know, through the whole thing.

434
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:50,525
- Of course.
- Plus, if I thought you were framing me

435
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,594
about anything,

436
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:55,664
I don't think we'd be sitting here
drinking an $800 bottle of wine.

437
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,700
I'd be outside, burying you in the woods.

438
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:03,306
Not if I buried you first.

439
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:07,477
Touché.

440
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:20,290
Hey, girlie, hold up.

441
00:19:20,324 --> 00:19:22,459
Can I help you?

442
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:24,294
Actually, I was thinking I could help you.

443
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,596
You know how earlier

444
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,264
you couldn't remember how there were

445
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,699
two ladies with you
that night you were here?

446
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:31,702
Yes.

447
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,438
My mind was blank, but yes.

448
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:35,706
So, to jog your memory,

449
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,476
I, uh, put together a couple sketches

450
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,591
of the women you were with.

451
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,682
So what do you think?

452
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,753
I think you're a very
talented artist, Carl.

453
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,605
Correct me if I'm wrong,

454
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,675
but wasn't our deal that,
if I won our tennis match,

455
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,310
you stay hidden until after regionals?

456
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:15,414
Actually, the deal was
that I stay in the cabin,

457
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:18,483
which is now full of
middle-aged honeymooners.

458
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,452
Here.

459
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:21,687
What is this?

460
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,522
It's a speech.

461
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,423
I was thinking about Ted's awards banquet,

462
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,559
and I just thought I'd help.

463
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,328
That's really sweet of you, Emma,

464
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,729
but I have it covered. Thank you.

465
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:32,465
Are you sure?

466
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:35,435
Because this is huge, Sutton.

467
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:37,704
I mean, the family is going to be together,

468
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,639
and Ted and Kristin are
in such a precarious place.

469
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:40,640
I said no.

470
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:44,478
Sutton?

471
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:49,450
Laurel, wait!

472
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:50,618
What's going on?

473
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:52,620
Look who finally decided

474
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:54,555
to do her hair today.

475
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,457
What are you doing? What do you want?

476
00:20:56,491 --> 00:20:58,759
Okay, I can't believe I'm
actually about to say this,

477
00:20:58,794 --> 00:21:01,295
but I wanted to thank you

478
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:03,597
for the advice you gave me about Jordan.

479
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:04,765
Seriously?

480
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,734
Yeah. I mean, I don't buy

481
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:08,703
the whole out-of-my-league thing,

482
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:12,306
but you were right about
him being wrong for me.

483
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,441
Well, you're welcome.

484
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:15,777
I'll show you to...

485
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:17,679
Actually, no. Uh, so,

486
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:19,647
after I told off Jordan,

487
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:21,649
which was incredibly fun, by the way,

488
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:25,353
I got to wondering.

489
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:27,755
What's wrong with us?

490
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,725
Why do the Mercer sisters

491
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,627
keep picking the wrong guys?

492
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:34,796
Justin, Jordan, Ethan?

493
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,632
Is this you giving me love advice?

494
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:40,469
I'm just asking.

495
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:43,472
Why are you wasting your
time tutoring Ethan, the guy

496
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:45,541
who broke your heart, when
you have someone like Thayer?

497
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:47,476
Oh, yeah, Thayer.

498
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,679
Of course, he's just so sweet and kind

499
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:53,516
and loyal as a puppy dog.

500
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,518
You say that like it's a bad thing.

501
00:21:57,521 --> 00:21:59,722
He cares about you.

502
00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:02,291
And for a while there,

503
00:22:02,326 --> 00:22:04,360
I thought you cared about him, too.

504
00:22:16,738 --> 00:22:17,705
Damn it!

505
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:25,346
Alec? Alec?!

506
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,748
What happened to the power?

507
00:22:27,782 --> 00:22:31,685
Alec? Are you there?

508
00:22:52,742 --> 00:22:54,777
Alec, where are you?

509
00:22:57,614 --> 00:22:59,415
Alec?

510
00:22:59,449 --> 00:23:00,749
Is this a joke?

511
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,642
That was quite a spill you took.

512
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:44,713
Get away.

513
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:45,947
You did that on purpose.

514
00:23:45,982 --> 00:23:48,749
- What?
- I know what you're doing.

515
00:23:48,784 --> 00:23:50,851
This whole honeymoon,

516
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:53,120
the little looks, the cryptic comments.

517
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:56,024
You're, you're screwing with my head!

518
00:23:56,058 --> 00:23:57,859
I know those lights

519
00:23:57,893 --> 00:23:59,761
didn't go off by themselves.

520
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:01,663
Yes, they did. That's
exactly what happened, honey.

521
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:02,798
I went outside to check the breakers,

522
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:03,999
and the box was locked.

523
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:06,035
I had to come back in and
get the key. I changed it.

524
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,904
You're lying.

525
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:11,007
Why don't you just cut this
whole loving husband act

526
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,843
and tell me why you brought me up here?

527
00:24:13,877 --> 00:24:15,611
Do you really think I framed you?

528
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:18,881
Sweetheart, we've been through this.

529
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,851
If I still thought that, then
where are the divorce papers?

530
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:24,787
What are we doing up here on our honeymoon?

531
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:27,623
Why would I move into your house and ask

532
00:24:27,657 --> 00:24:30,859
my daughter to do the exact same thing?

533
00:24:30,893 --> 00:24:35,798
How could I possibly make love to you?

534
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:38,868
Sweetheart, if I thought you betrayed me

535
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:40,770
and yet did all those things,

536
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:43,874
what kind of man would that make me?

537
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:46,810
Come here.

538
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:20,943
Why do I get the feeling
you're not just running late?

539
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,612
I'm sorry.

540
00:25:23,646 --> 00:25:24,980
I would have called earlier,

541
00:25:25,014 --> 00:25:26,748
but something really important came up.

542
00:25:26,782 --> 00:25:27,982
Sound like you're on the road.

543
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:33,688
I'm on a bus... to L.A.

544
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:37,658
Of course you are.

545
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:40,061
I care about him, Ethan.

546
00:25:40,095 --> 00:25:42,063
And we both know you're
better off being tutored

547
00:25:42,098 --> 00:25:43,732
by somebody else anyway.

548
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:44,866
You're right.

549
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,102
Tell Thayer hey.

550
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,734
I'm... really sorry.

551
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,995
So am I.

552
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,800
Thought Sutton was coming
over to help you study.

553
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:02,868
It's a change of plans.

554
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:04,636
You pissed her off, didn't you?

555
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:08,673
Yes, I did. Anything else?

556
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:11,976
Ethan, the way I see it,
you can either sit here

557
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,844
and feel sorry for yourself,

558
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:15,913
or you can go find Sutton
and beg for forgiveness.

559
00:26:15,947 --> 00:26:17,748
Because I'm telling you,

560
00:26:17,782 --> 00:26:19,649
her help is the only thing
that is standing between you

561
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:21,045
and a trip back to juvie right now.

562
00:26:23,887 --> 00:26:24,987
It's a good speech, Dan.

563
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:26,955
Just a little too late.

564
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:34,729
Look, nobody wants

565
00:26:34,764 --> 00:26:36,764
these two back together more than I do,

566
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,768
but, I mean, one day,
they're fighting in public,

567
00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:43,737
and the next day we're in counseling trying

568
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:44,939
to work things out.

569
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:46,742
Meanwhile, everyone's miserable..

570
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:48,078
Honey, it's a process.

571
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:50,747
Your mother and I are both
working very hard to try...

572
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:55,085
When does it end? I'm sorry, I know
this is going to sound terrible,

573
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,988
but sometimes I look around me and see how

574
00:26:58,022 --> 00:26:59,989
this is affecting everybody,

575
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:03,593
and I just think maybe the
two of you are better off...

576
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:05,929
What are you saying, Sutton?

577
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:08,031
You want Mom and Dad to
get a divorce just because

578
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:11,670
it's too hard for you to
watch them work things out?

579
00:27:11,704 --> 00:27:13,872
I'm saying that they
need to make a decision

580
00:27:13,906 --> 00:27:15,807
and stick with it.

581
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,976
Do you have any idea how
selfish you sound right now?

582
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,745
Oh, really, Laurel? And what
if Mom actually wants a divorce?

583
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,915
Okay, I think maybe everyone
needs to take a little time-out.

584
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,949
Who asked you?

585
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:26,751
- Laurel!
- That's okay.

586
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:30,622
Actually, I think...

587
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:32,590
I think I understand what Sutton is saying.

588
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:35,826
And in her own way, she's, she's
just trying to look out for me.

589
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:36,994
Why do you think that?

590
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:39,697
Well, Sutton's always been strong-willed,

591
00:27:39,732 --> 00:27:43,802
and while it hasn't made
it easy being her mom,

592
00:27:43,836 --> 00:27:46,872
I've always just admired that strength.

593
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:49,942
You know, when she was a baby,

594
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:52,877
the night Sutton came
home to live with us was

595
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:57,776
the happiest of my life,
but I was terrified.

596
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,011
I mean, the adoption...
it happened so quickly.

597
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:04,014
I felt so unprepared.

598
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:08,548
What if I did something wrong?

599
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:12,948
What if you cried, and
I couldn't comfort you?

600
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,973
I stayed with you in the nursery
all night just holding you.

601
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:19,803
And you know what?

602
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:21,835
You didn't cry at all.

603
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:25,766
You were so calm, just looking around,

604
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,632
taking everything in.

605
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,764
I know this sounds crazy,
but it was almost...

606
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:36,863
it's almost like you
were being strong for me.

607
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,767
It's great that you
intercepted that drawing of me,

608
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:47,637
but it is just a reminder that
we are running out of time.

609
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:49,873
I think it's time we step things up.

610
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:51,674
Well, what does that mean exactly?

611
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,576
Because we're doing everything that we can.

612
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,710
Well, are we?

613
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:56,578
I mean, I hate to say it, Sutton,

614
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:58,713
but it sounds like family
therapy was kind of a bust.

615
00:28:58,748 --> 00:29:01,815
Okay, look, I know it didn't
go as well as I had planned,

616
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,783
but I'm working on this
speech for the banquet,

617
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:05,818
and trust me...

618
00:29:05,853 --> 00:29:08,521
I am covering everything:

619
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:11,923
the lies, the infidelity, the fights

620
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,658
between Ted and Kristin.

621
00:29:13,692 --> 00:29:15,856
Well, that's good,

622
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,858
um, but I think we need to take
things a little bit further.

623
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:19,925
Well, how much further?

624
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,628
I mean, when you take that stage

625
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:25,730
with Kristin sitting in the front row,

626
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,966
that's when you tell everybody the truth;

627
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:31,503
that Dr. Ted Mercer is
your biological father.

628
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:32,871
- You're kidding.
- Not at all.

629
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,639
But are you sure?

630
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:38,543
I mean, look, I know that that's huge,

631
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,945
But don't you think it's a little much?

632
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,915
Plus, people will know that
you're my mother if I say that.

633
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,784
I know...

634
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,919
And no one will be more shocked than I.

635
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:52,765
After all, who knew that
you were the daughter

636
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,707
I was forced to give up 17 years ago?

637
00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:58,877
Well, what about Alec?

638
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,546
What's he gonna say when
all of this comes out?

639
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,947
Don't worry about that.

640
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:04,782
You just work on the speech,

641
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,018
and when the time comes,

642
00:30:07,053 --> 00:30:10,555
I'll take care of Alec Rybak.

643
00:30:16,763 --> 00:30:18,563
What's with the suitcase?

644
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:24,804
I mean, I know we've been kind
of been avoiding each other,

645
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:26,639
but you're moving out?

646
00:30:26,673 --> 00:30:29,843
You're right, I have been avoiding you,

647
00:30:29,877 --> 00:30:32,579
but that's not why I'm leaving.

648
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:35,648
Um...

649
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:37,650
my dad is staying at Rebecca's now

650
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:39,985
and wants me to move in with him tomorrow.

651
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,956
Rebecca's... where Jordan lives.

652
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:45,991
Unfortunately.

653
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:48,027
You know, if you liked him,
you could have just told me.

654
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:50,930
Well, the thing is, I don't.

655
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:53,933
And now I'm just really
sorry that this whole

656
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:55,735
stupid incident came between us.

657
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:58,938
Yeah, me, too.

658
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:02,775
We're friends?

659
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:04,710
Yeah, friends.

660
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:07,747
Well, then, as your friend...

661
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,817
and I know you say you're not interested...

662
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:12,652
but I'm totally over Jordan,

663
00:31:12,686 --> 00:31:15,655
so if you're thinking of
kissing him again, go for it.

664
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:17,757
Thank you, but there
are a million reasons why

665
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,593
that's never gonna happen,

666
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,862
including the fact that
we are practically related.

667
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:22,977
And you're sure about that?

668
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:25,798
Positive.

669
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:36,742
Hi! Thayer, thank God.

670
00:31:36,776 --> 00:31:38,577
Why didn't you call me back?

671
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:40,731
Did you get my message about
the desk clerk telling me

672
00:31:40,747 --> 00:31:41,947
that there were two women at the motel?

673
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:43,015
Okay, slow down.

674
00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:45,684
What? I thought you'd be happy to see me.

675
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:48,020
You asked me to come here, and here I am.

676
00:31:48,054 --> 00:31:51,958
Yeah, I am, but I asked you to
come with me... two days ago.

677
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,898
I didn't realize there
was an expiration date.

678
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:58,728
Oh, hey! Who's this?

679
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:01,661
Uh...

680
00:32:01,696 --> 00:32:03,696
uh...

681
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:04,965
No one.

682
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,573
Emma...

683
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:10,943
Emma, could you stop for a second?

684
00:32:10,977 --> 00:32:12,915
That girl you saw is just...

685
00:32:12,949 --> 00:32:14,655
What? Payback? Look, maybe

686
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:16,762
I should have said yes
and come with you out here.

687
00:32:16,797 --> 00:32:18,635
But you need to get past the stupid idea

688
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:19,804
that I have feelings for Ethan!

689
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,920
Okay, listen, I really don't

690
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,878
want to talk about this right now, okay?

691
00:32:22,912 --> 00:32:24,683
Right now or ever?

692
00:32:24,717 --> 00:32:26,588
Listen, stop.

693
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:29,058
Can I at least give you
a ride to the bus station?

694
00:32:29,092 --> 00:32:30,829
Don't bother.

695
00:32:30,864 --> 00:32:33,034
You don't want to keep your blonde waiting.

696
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,556
- Hey.
- Hi.

697
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,857
Big day, huh?

698
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:52,993
Yeah.

699
00:32:53,027 --> 00:32:57,731
It could end up being a lot
bigger than people realize.

700
00:32:57,765 --> 00:32:59,467
What are you talking about?

701
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:00,668
Nothing.

702
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:03,738
Just nervous for my speech.

703
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:06,474
Still I'm not quite sure
what I'm going to say.

704
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:10,545
Yeah, well, before she left, Emma seemed

705
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:12,581
kind of worried about that, too.

706
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,583
Big surprise.

707
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,485
She always expects the worst of me.

708
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,755
Well, maybe this is your
chance to prove her wrong.

709
00:33:22,992 --> 00:33:24,826
Oh, hey, sweetheart.

710
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,528
Oh, you look beautiful.

711
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:27,696
Thank you.

712
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:28,897
You, too.

713
00:33:28,931 --> 00:33:31,600
You feeling nervous about your speech?

714
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,870
Little more than I thought I would.

715
00:33:33,904 --> 00:33:35,505
It's gonna be fine.

716
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:37,807
Um...

717
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:40,710
hey, Mom, that story you told yesterday

718
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:44,681
at therapy about my first night at home?

719
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:46,783
How come you never told me that before?

720
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:50,787
Well, honey, I'm... I'm sure I did.

721
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:54,791
Maybe it's just the
first time you listened.

722
00:34:16,547 --> 00:34:17,613
Oh, my.

723
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:19,782
Hey there.

724
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,751
Moving in already?

725
00:34:22,785 --> 00:34:24,653
No, not until tomorrow.

726
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,888
- I'm just dropping off a few things.
- Why don't you

727
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:27,589
drop your bags and hang out for a minute?

728
00:34:27,624 --> 00:34:28,724
No, thank you.

729
00:34:28,758 --> 00:34:31,560
Well, why don't you let me help you?

730
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:32,828
Unpack later.

731
00:34:34,964 --> 00:34:36,498
What the hell was that?

732
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,801
Stop smiling.

733
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:40,903
'Cause whatever you think is
about to happen really isn't.

734
00:34:40,937 --> 00:34:41,904
Oh, is that right?

735
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:43,706
Yeah.

736
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,508
What's really going on here, Mads?

737
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,910
And don't say dropping
the sweaters off and stuff,

738
00:34:46,944 --> 00:34:47,977
'cause you could do that tomorrow.

739
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:53,783
I promised myself I wouldn't.

740
00:34:53,817 --> 00:34:56,653
Well, then, I guess you lied.

741
00:35:05,698 --> 00:35:07,466
The biggest gift my father

742
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,668
has given me is the example he's set

743
00:35:09,702 --> 00:35:13,705
by donating his time and
talents to others in need.

744
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,574
That's why we're here today,

745
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:18,477
and it's why I'm proud to call him my dad.

746
00:35:31,956 --> 00:35:35,725
So...

747
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,662
I had written a speech

748
00:35:38,696 --> 00:35:40,897
about my dad...

749
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,734
um, bunch of clichés

750
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:46,569
about how great of a doctor he is,

751
00:35:46,604 --> 00:35:48,570
how great of a humanitarian,
and don't get me wrong,

752
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,738
that's very true.

753
00:35:51,974 --> 00:35:57,479
But today I want to
talk about another truth.

754
00:35:59,482 --> 00:36:03,652
Something you don't know about Ted Mercer.

755
00:36:03,686 --> 00:36:05,654
And that...

756
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:18,568
and that...

757
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:21,604
is...

758
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,706
that his greatest accomplishment
and the smartest thing

759
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:27,844
he has ever done was to
marry my mom Kristin Mercer.

760
00:36:27,878 --> 00:36:32,481
Because she is the one
who makes this family work.

761
00:36:32,516 --> 00:36:34,917
And together, she and my dad

762
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:37,787
have built a life that any child would

763
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:41,757
be so lucky to be a part of.

764
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:43,859
Even an ungrateful daughter

765
00:36:43,893 --> 00:36:46,795
who hasn't always paid attention

766
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,564
enough to notice.

767
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:58,773
Honey, that was...

768
00:36:58,808 --> 00:37:01,609
Ladies and gentlemen,

769
00:37:01,643 --> 00:37:04,445
Phoenix Surgical Humanitarian
of the Year, Dr. Ted Mercer.

770
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:05,678
Hey, Sutton.

771
00:37:05,713 --> 00:37:06,781
Ethan, not right now, please.

772
00:37:06,815 --> 00:37:07,881
W... what? That was great.

773
00:37:09,718 --> 00:37:10,851
No, it wasn't.

774
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:12,920
You don't understand. It wasn't great.

775
00:37:12,954 --> 00:37:15,756
Are you kidding me? You were real up there.

776
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,493
Okay, so many times you've
talked about how you've changed,

777
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,462
but that was from the heart.

778
00:37:21,497 --> 00:37:23,598
All right, that was the...

779
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:25,712
that was the Sutton Mercer
from the ranch that night.

780
00:37:27,637 --> 00:37:29,504
Well, wonderful.

781
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,540
I gave a sappy speech about my parents

782
00:37:31,574 --> 00:37:32,707
in front of a bunch of doctors.

783
00:37:32,742 --> 00:37:34,476
What is that going to get me?

784
00:37:36,746 --> 00:37:37,679
This.

785
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,214
Home sweet home.

786
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,319
So quiet.

787
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:01,422
Jordan.

788
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:04,025
I think I hear him out by the pool.

789
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:05,326
All right, well, will you say hi for me?

790
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,395
- I'm gonna go upstairs and take a bath.
- Sure.

791
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:10,331
Bye, baby.

792
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:20,074
Alec.

793
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:22,108
Hey.

794
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:23,311
How was the, uh, how was the honeymoon?

795
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:26,047
It was memorable.

796
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:28,082
Good.

797
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:29,284
You're doing laps at this hour, huh?

798
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:30,418
Yeah.

799
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:35,057
You haven't seen Mads, have you?

800
00:38:35,091 --> 00:38:37,226
She was going to stop by
here and drop some stuff off.

801
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,360
No, I haven't seen her.

802
00:38:38,394 --> 00:38:40,129
She might have been here earlier

803
00:38:40,163 --> 00:38:42,030
while I was gone, though. Don't know.

804
00:38:42,065 --> 00:38:43,232
Good night.

805
00:39:00,184 --> 00:39:02,418
I thought you said you weren't
going to do that anymore.

806
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:06,289
Well, I thought so, too.

807
00:39:06,323 --> 00:39:08,357
And now we're living under the same roof.

808
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:10,192
So, things went pretty
bad with Thayer, huh?

809
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:11,994
Yeah.

810
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:14,063
Should have known it
wouldn't work out, though,

811
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:16,198
when he didn't return
any of my phone calls.

812
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:18,000
Oh, well, when are you coming back?

813
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:19,135
Soon.

814
00:39:19,169 --> 00:39:21,070
The last bus out last night was canceled,

815
00:39:21,104 --> 00:39:23,345
so I had to sleep here at the
station, and it was just...

816
00:39:23,373 --> 00:39:25,140
Shower's free if you want it.

817
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:26,407
Who are you talking to?

818
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:29,378
- Sutton.
- Oh, great.

819
00:39:29,412 --> 00:39:33,215
Hey, I didn't realize you'd
left already, but I just wanted

820
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:35,050
to say good luck at regionals

821
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:37,219
and reiterate how completely genius

822
00:39:37,254 --> 00:39:38,487
that speech was last night.

823
00:39:38,521 --> 00:39:40,456
Thank you.

824
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,225
Love you.

825
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,396
Anyways, um,

826
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,298
I guess I will just check
in on you later, okay?

827
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,433
Wait, Mads, no, don't, tell me what...

828
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:01,043
Sutton, I thought you were on your...

829
00:40:01,078 --> 00:40:02,111
Running late, so do you mind moving?

830
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:03,413
I can get a yogurt.

831
00:40:03,447 --> 00:40:05,381
Thank you.

832
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:10,387
Saguaro Bus Lines 237

833
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:15,192
to Riverside, San Bernardino,
and Phoenix, now boarding.

834
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:20,197
Thank you.

835
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:26,304
Let's see...

836
00:40:29,174 --> 00:40:30,508
You missed this.

837
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:34,079
What are you doing here?

838
00:40:34,113 --> 00:40:35,514
Oh, I checked the bus schedule,

839
00:40:35,548 --> 00:40:38,317
figured I still might be able to catch you.

840
00:40:41,488 --> 00:40:45,458
Listen, Emma, that girl you saw
at my apartment is just a friend.

841
00:40:45,492 --> 00:40:47,527
We surf together, but that's it.

842
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:50,229
Well, why didn't you just tell me that?

843
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:53,433
Because I can be hardheaded sometimes.

844
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:55,235
But I also don't want
to be one of those guys

845
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,104
That lets pride get in the
way of what he really wants.

846
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:59,273
And what do you really want?

847
00:40:59,307 --> 00:41:01,408
One question:

848
00:41:01,443 --> 00:41:03,110
those messages you left about Sutton

849
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:05,112
and the second woman at the motel...

850
00:41:05,146 --> 00:41:07,047
did you come here because you want my help

851
00:41:07,082 --> 00:41:08,115
or because you want me?

852
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:13,321
Both.

853
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:15,223
Thayer, when you left, I... I...

854
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:39,570
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

855
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:43,453
What the hell happened at the banquet?

856
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:45,155
I don't know, I...

857
00:41:45,189 --> 00:41:48,458
You had a golden
opportunity and you folded.

858
00:41:48,492 --> 00:41:50,226
Are you going soft on me?

859
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:53,095
No...

860
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,131
Look, I just realized that
my feelings for Kristin

861
00:41:55,165 --> 00:41:57,132
are a little bit more
complicated than I had thought.

862
00:41:57,167 --> 00:42:01,069
And I know she's not my mother, but I...

863
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:02,504
But maybe you prefer her to be.

864
00:42:02,538 --> 00:42:04,506
No.

865
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:08,077
I was just up on that stage,
and... and to humiliate her

866
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,245
in front of everybody...

867
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,514
I'm just not as okay with it as you are.

868
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:14,117
Well, I'm very sorry to
hear that, sweetheart,

869
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:15,318
because now you've
forced me to do something

870
00:42:15,352 --> 00:42:17,053
I was hoping I could avoid.

871
00:42:17,087 --> 00:42:18,354
What is this?

872
00:42:18,388 --> 00:42:21,257
It's a journal, handwritten
by Kristin Mercer.

873
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:24,260
Read it and you'll see,
when you were a baby, that

874
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:27,330
this "wonderful mother" that
you spoke so glowingly about

875
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:30,266
wanted to give you away.
