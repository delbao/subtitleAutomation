1
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:03,417
<i>My name is Debbie Weaver.</i>

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:04,653
<i>This is my family.</i>

3
00:00:04,673 --> 00:00:06,978
<i>This is our old apartment
in Bayonne, New Jersey.</i>

4
00:00:06,998 --> 00:00:09,671
<i>My husband Marty got us a deal
on a town house...</i>

5
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:11,892
<i>nicer neighborhood,
wider streets.</i>

6
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,667
<i>Just one little problem...</i>

7
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:15,896
<i>our neighbors are all
from another planet...</i>

8
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:18,067
<i>Literally.</i>

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,446
Look at this, Marty.

10
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:27,278
There's so much
to volunteer for.

11
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:29,698
We could make a real difference
at this school.

12
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:32,775
This is boring.
Humans are boring.

13
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:35,121
Larry Bird is underwhelmed.

14
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:37,006
Well, why don't you find
something that interests you?

15
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:39,694
Yeah, like, I think
we're gonna join the P.T.A.

16
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:40,766
(Breathes deeply)

17
00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:42,826
- What? What was that?
- I don't know. The P.T.A.?

18
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:45,679
I mean, maybe this year
we should volunteer for different things.

19
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:47,661
You know?
I could coach soccer.

20
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,286
(Scoffs) Oh, coaching.

21
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:51,747
- Okay, what was that?
- I love when you coach. Love it.

22
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:53,503
Well, you talk about
making a difference.

23
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:54,868
Well, coaching is it.

24
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,769
What's better than
molding young minds

25
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,507
through organized athletics,
right?

26
00:00:58,527 --> 00:01:01,071
- Oh, that sounds interesting.
- Come on, Marty.

27
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:03,036
It's you blowing a whistle
while a bunch of kids

28
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:05,530
run across a field like
a herd of confused cattle.

29
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,250
It's hardly Manchester United.

30
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,694
What does this, uh,
P.T.A. do exactly?

31
00:01:09,714 --> 00:01:11,208
- It helps the school...
- Bake sales.

32
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:13,603
Bake sales
are a small part of it.

33
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:16,408
It's also a chance
to install an arts program.

34
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:18,966
Yeah, and get mired in bickering
and petty politics.

35
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:22,386
Bickering and petty politics?
Oh, that sounds delightful.

36
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,489
Just like zabvronian council.

37
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,732
Wife, I think I will join Debbie Weaver
on this T.P.A.,

38
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:31,760
- and you can coach soccer with Marty.
- Oh, excellent!

39
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,118
Now hold on. Do you even
know anything about sports?

40
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:36,624
Oh, yes. I was nothing exceptional as a child,

41
00:01:36,644 --> 00:01:39,594
but sports gave me some
much-needed self-esteem.

42
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:43,029
I was hoping that our little Dick
might follow in my footsteps.

43
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,941
(Dick Butkus, groaning)
Why are you fighting me?

44
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:46,959
(Groaning)

45
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:49,081
(Ball bounces)
(Sighing)

46
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,566
Good luck, coach.
(Pats back)

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,551
S01E11
The Gingerbread Man

48
00:01:55,585 --> 00:01:58,554
Sync by <font color="#ff69b4">ninh</font>
www.addic7ed.com

49
00:01:58,835 --> 00:01:59,788
(clicks tongue)

50
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:01,754
Well, this is
boilerplate stuff.

51
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:05,094
You say this is similar
to your Zabvronian council?

52
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:06,729
You should have no trouble
keeping up.

53
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:08,445
- Where's your butcher of hope?
- Hmm?

54
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:11,675
Tall chap, wears a dark hood
to mask his eternal sorrow.

55
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:13,753
Puts an end to debates.

56
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:17,023
How can you have a proper meeting
without a butcher of hope?

57
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:19,213
Maybe skim this.

58
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:23,403
The next item on the agenda
is the bake sale for the new soccer uniforms.

59
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:25,649
Now, after giving it
a lot of thought,

60
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:27,399
I've decided
we'll sell brownies.

61
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:28,284
All in favor?

62
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,655
Ooh! Excuse me.
I'm Debbie Weaver,

63
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:34,373
- Max and Abby's mom.
- Hello, Debbie.

64
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:36,459
I don't know your children,
but I'm sure you've taught them

65
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:38,511
how rude it is
to interrupt someone.

66
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:40,643
Oh. Fun.

67
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:43,766
Well, uh, okay. I have
a couple of ideas.

68
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:45,664
Back at our old school in Bayonne,

69
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:48,746
we made gingerbread cookies
for the bake sale,

70
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:51,228
and we decorated them
like the soccer team,

71
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:52,274
and the kids loved 'em.

72
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:54,488
And we ended up making a lot of m...
(Gavel bangs)

73
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,972
Money.

74
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:57,427
We made...

75
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:58,564
it was a lot of...
(Gavel bangs)

76
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:01,734
They were... delicious.

77
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,728
(Whispering) The president has
become your butcher of hope.

78
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:06,626
- Nothing good can come of this.
- (Under breath) Just zip it!

79
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:07,788
Thank you, Debbie.

80
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:10,411
I'm sure in Bayonne,
you used what you had,

81
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:13,579
and I admire that, but we have
different standards here.

82
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:15,641
So we'll be making brownies.

83
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:18,483
This is ridiculous!
Marty was right.

84
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:20,753
The P.T.A. Is just petty politics. Let's go.

85
00:03:20,804 --> 00:03:22,722
(Normal voice)
We shall do no such thing.

86
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:24,757
This woman is not only
attacking your idea,

87
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:28,094
she's attacking your very being,
your way of life, your children.

88
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,979
I think she just likes
brownies.

89
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:31,764
Excuse me.

90
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:34,266
According to your guidelines,

91
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:36,440
any decisions
regarding fund-raising

92
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,922
must be voted upon
by the entire group.

93
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:41,821
Therefore, I move we vote...

94
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,610
gingerbread men or brownies?

95
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,683
I second the motion.
(Women murmuring)

96
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,565
Fine. Next week,
you'll have your vote.

97
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:55,498
- What do we do now?
- Divide and conquer.

98
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:58,452
When Linda's not around,
it'll be easier to convince them.

99
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,742
We'll go after them
separately.

100
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:01,616
Ooh! Pick 'em off
one by one.

101
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:04,632
Yes, and together,
we shall rule the galaxy.

102
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:06,263
- What?
- What?

103
00:04:06,283 --> 00:04:08,029
(Children shouting)
(Marty) Keep moving, guys!

104
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:09,846
Keep it going! Pass the ball!

105
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,881
Nice work, Dick. Way to get
a piece of that ball.

106
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,507
It's a great job.

107
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:16,331
I'm confused.
I'm very confused.

108
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:18,974
It would appear that Dick
is not doing a great job.

109
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:21,642
In fact, I would say that he is
the worst player on the team,

110
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:24,297
and yet you keep lying
about his performance.

111
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:27,178
Listen, Jackie, coaching's about
positive reinforcement.

112
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:30,292
Okay, let's face it, kid's
never gonna be David Beckham.

113
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,638
(Scoffs) We almost named him
David Beckham.

114
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:34,616
As a matter of fact,
I think with some practice,

115
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:37,872
Dick could be the greatest soccer player
the world has ever seen.

116
00:04:38,308 --> 00:04:39,889
Yeah, not so much.

117
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:43,211
I would lower
those expectations... a lot.

118
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:46,643
Well, maybe he could at least grow up
to look like David Beckham.

119
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,497
Mm, nope.

120
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:50,880
But if we encourage him,
he'll probably have a good time.

121
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,051
Come on, guys,
keep it going! Move it along!

122
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:54,411
Get the ball, dick!

123
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,839
Ow! (Grunts)
Ow!

124
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:58,817
That's it! Way to go, Dick!

125
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:01,088
You almost made contact
that time, buddy!

126
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:04,085
Thanks.
Felt great, coach. Ow!

127
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:04,949
(Scoffs)

128
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:06,823
Yeah, not David Beckham.

129
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:09,776
Remember, you are stronger
than these women, Debbie Weaver.

130
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:12,424
They must do your bidding
or feel your wrath.

131
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:16,868
Oh, thanks, Larry. You know, it's nice
to have a man supporting me on this.

132
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,693
Do I have lipstick
on my teeth?

133
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:20,728
Yes, but I thought
that was on purpose.

134
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:23,115
Hi... Elizabeth.

135
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:24,461
I'm sorry to bother you
at home,

136
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:26,037
but we were wondering
if you had a few minutes

137
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,750
to talk about the bake sale.

138
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,859
I really haven't thought
much about it.

139
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,502
I usually just vote with Linda,
but I'll let you know.

140
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:35,337
Elizabeth, Debbie Weaver
has spent all morning

141
00:05:35,357 --> 00:05:37,460
putting lipstick on her teeth
to come talk to you.

142
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,060
I insist you hear her out.

143
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,119
He's very passionate
about the P.T.A.

144
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:43,949
Okay. (Breathing nervously)

145
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,184
But the last time
I voted against Linda,

146
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:47,570
my daughter didn't have
a playdate for, like, a year.

147
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:50,136
She's kinda chunky. She needs
all the friends she can get.

148
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:52,311
And that's why this is
so important,

149
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,508
- because the P.T.A. is about everyone.
- Everyone.

150
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:55,823
Not just one person.

151
00:05:55,843 --> 00:05:57,722
Yes,
today it's about cookies.

152
00:05:57,742 --> 00:06:01,238
Tomorrow it's banning your potbellied daughter
from the yearbook.

153
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:03,112
Elizabeth,
mother to mother,

154
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:05,577
we can't let Linda
get away with this.

155
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:08,108
(Exhales) Come in.

156
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,099
(Under breath) Excellent.

157
00:06:16,136 --> 00:06:19,375
Plus gingerbread cookies have
fewer calories than brownies.

158
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:22,455
I know you like to feed
your kids healthy foods.

159
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,900
I know you have
a blog about it, yeah.

160
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,749
Listen, Tracy, I gotta
start making dinner.

161
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:28,164
Can I count on your vote?

162
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:30,447
Yeah? Great! Thanks! Oh!
(Door closes)

163
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,184
(Telephone beeps)
Whoo-hoo!

164
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:33,433
(Laughing)

165
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,546
Oh, dear lord, those shorts.

166
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,693
Yeah, they still fit.

167
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:41,368
Do they?

168
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:43,965
- How was your practice?
- It was awesome.

169
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,655
You know what? I really feel like
I'm starting to make a difference.

170
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:50,142
How about you? How is your
little, uh, cookie thing coming?

171
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,242
It's not a little cookie thing,
Marty, okay?

172
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,732
I'm fighting to keep the P.T.A. democratic.

173
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:56,767
- Right. With gingerbread man.
- That's right.

174
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:59,348
I mean, I'm not chasing
little kids around in lady pants all day, but...

175
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:03,228
Okay, hold on, hold on. I'm not chasing
kids around in lady pants, okay?

176
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:05,503
I'm creating
lifelong memories.

177
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:06,992
All right, you know what?
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,662
I'm glad that you are
enjoying coaching.

179
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,373
I just think it was
a good decision for us

180
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:13,215
- to do separate things.
- Yeah, it was a great decision,

181
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,911
and I'm happy that you're
enjoying the P.T.A.

182
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:18,013
Well, I'm happy you're happy
I'm enjoying the P.T.A.

183
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,330
Whew.

184
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:33,733
So, tell me, Debbie Weaver,

185
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,603
does gingerbread man
taste the same as regular man?

186
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,407
- No.
- Oh!

187
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:39,611
Hello, Debbie.

188
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:41,527
Out seeing
how the other half lives?

189
00:07:41,547 --> 00:07:42,775
Hi, Linda.

190
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,731
Don't tell me you're still
trying to drum up support

191
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,976
- for your gingerbread cookies?
- We are.

192
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:48,726
And we've just acquired
the necessary votes

193
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:51,712
to overrule your brownie
mandate, so take that, lady.

194
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:54,670
You know, I've been president
of the P.T.A. for a long time,

195
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,568
and I've seen your type
come and go.

196
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:57,814
You move to the suburbs

197
00:07:57,834 --> 00:08:00,023
and bring the bad ideas
from the city with you.

198
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:02,301
Well, I'm not gonna let that
happen here, okay?

199
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:04,736
Great. Beep-beep.

200
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:06,812
Ow! (Seethes)

201
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:08,678
Ow, God.

202
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:10,771
(Baby crying)

203
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:16,851
Wow. She's really into the P.T.A.

204
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:21,004
Maybe we should just let her
do what she wants.

205
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:22,551
Absolutely not.

206
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:25,174
I have a plan that will
guarantee us victory.

207
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:27,366
Yeah? Okay.

208
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,618
But don't do anything weird.

209
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:32,211
(Scoffs) You're weird.

210
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:37,870
(Electricity crackling)

211
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,034
(Door opens)

212
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:42,827
Good evening, husband.

213
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:44,626
Oh, hello, wife.

214
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,237
Oh, you look troubled.
What's the matter?

215
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:48,329
(Sighs)

216
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:50,174
Dick had soccer practice today.

217
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,313
And he was really quite awful,
but Marty Weaver

218
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,741
kept on telling him
he was doing a good job.

219
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,339
He called it
"positive reinforcement."

220
00:08:57,359 --> 00:09:01,532
Oh, these humans and their
"everyone's special" baloney.

221
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:04,746
Have fun sucking hind teat
to the rest of the universe, losers.

222
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:07,699
Uh, I'm very concerned
that if dick is a poor athlete,

223
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,950
he'll lack self-esteem
and fail to grow up

224
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,998
to be a strong, confident
black woman like his mother.

225
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:17,676
I found myself in sport.
I was hoping he would, too.

226
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:21,628
Well, you might need to take
more control of the situation.

227
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:24,872
These humans are surprisingly soft.
They must be pushed into action.

228
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:26,651
You know what's best
for your son.

229
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:28,521
You must be fierce
and take no prisoners.

230
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,285
(Sighs)

231
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:31,449
- Ooh, I don't know, husband.
- Yes, you can do this.

232
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:33,720
Be fierce
and take no prisoners.

233
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,700
Say it with me.

234
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,934
- Be fierce and take no prisoners.
- Fierce and prisoners... no... I... sorry.

235
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:39,577
Well, it's close enough.

236
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:42,715
And if all else fails, we can always install
a performance chip in Dick's brain.

237
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:44,738
Oh... (Laughs)
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

238
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:45,924
Ohh!

239
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,877
- Thanks, Boo.
- Welcome, Snookems.

240
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:49,354
Mmm.
(Door closes)

241
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:50,642
(Exhales)

242
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:04,659
(creaks)

243
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,121
Reggie Jackson,
are you in position?

244
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,286
(Door squeaks)

245
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:13,346
Yes, father.
Target acquired.

246
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,196
Activate gingerbread device.

247
00:10:19,216 --> 00:10:20,916
Understood.

248
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:33,921
<i>(high-pitched voice)
Linda?</i>

249
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:35,534
Oh, Linda?

250
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:48,074
Hi, Linda!

251
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,065
Linda?

252
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:52,559
Hello?

253
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:53,974
<i>Is somebody there?</i>

254
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:55,956
(Shower running)

255
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:06,346
Who's there?

256
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:15,523
<i>(High-pitched voice)
Linda!</i>

257
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:17,794
Is somebody here?

258
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:21,190
<i>Hello, Linda.</i>

259
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:26,879
Aah!

260
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,647
<i>(High-pitched screaming)</i>

261
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:30,308
Aah!

262
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,552
<i>(High-pitched screaming
and laughing)</i>

263
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:34,853
(Thud)

264
00:11:37,846 --> 00:11:39,324
The next... (Clears throat)

265
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:42,182
The next item
on the age-agenda...

266
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,200
- (rattling) What was that?!
- What was what?

267
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,692
(Lowered voice)
She seems so nervous.

268
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:49,360
- I think she knows we got the votes.
- (Lowered voice) Perhaps.

269
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,537
Or... perhaps she's suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder

270
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:55,627
from something I may or may not have made happen
at her house last night.

271
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:57,498
What did you do?

272
00:11:57,518 --> 00:11:58,813
I defeated her.

273
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,845
Where I'm from, we wage war
through psychological destruction.

274
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:05,782
Our goal is to mentally
crush our enemies

275
00:12:05,802 --> 00:12:08,339
until they can no longer
function in society.

276
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,321
I just wanted
gingerbread cookies.

277
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,974
And gingerbread cookies
you shall have.

278
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:15,114
(Normal voice) Excuse me.

279
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,912
I have a question regarding
the bake sale.

280
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:21,550
(Pants) Stay away from me,
gingerbread man!

281
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:24,118
(Screaming)

282
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:27,271
(Women murmuring)

283
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:30,974
The P.T.A. is yours, Debbie Weaver.

284
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:34,536
Well... crap.

285
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,501
I know you're tired, Dick,

286
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:38,512
but this is
for your own good.

287
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:40,199
Thank you, mother.
You were right.

288
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:43,016
The pain in my side
did eventually go numb.

289
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:44,679
Hey! What's going on?

290
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:48,298
We're running motivational laps.
This is 310.

291
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:50,678
I'm doing what I must
to protect my son.

292
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:52,850
I don't want him to have
the same childhood I did.

293
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,786
(Children shouting)
(Blows whistle)

294
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:56,089
Let's go, team! Come on!

295
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,677
Gather round! Bring it in!

296
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:59,934
Listen, tomorrow is
our first game, okay?

297
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:02,825
And if we go out there
and we do the best we can

298
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:05,799
and we have some fun,
I think we can win!

299
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:07,983
No, no, no, no, no.

300
00:13:08,107 --> 00:13:10,197
We can win, but we won't.
(Sighs)

301
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:12,727
And why not?

302
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:16,115
(Voice breaking) Because there
is a weak link among us.

303
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:19,272
It's you, Dick Butkus.

304
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:22,342
Your weaknesses are simply
too strong to overcome.

305
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:24,791
- And therefore you are off the team.
- What?

306
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:27,918
Your assessment of my abilities
is blunt but precise.

307
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:30,197
I shall take my leave.

308
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,279
You can't kick him
off the team.

309
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:35,756
Oh, well, he's the weakest,

310
00:13:35,776 --> 00:13:38,672
and I must be fierce
and take no prisoners.

311
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,471
It will motivate him
to work harder.

312
00:13:40,491 --> 00:13:42,989
Okay, well, I'm the coach,
and I say that he stays.

313
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:45,310
Fine. You're off
the team, Marty.

314
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,581
<i>You can't kick me off!
(Laughing) I'm the coach!</i>

315
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:50,075
Team, loyalty vote.

316
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,380
Would you rather follow me
to victory

317
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,726
or coach Weaver
to certain defeat?

318
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:56,111
(Sighs)
Choose now!

319
00:13:58,636 --> 00:13:59,238
Max?

320
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:02,722
Come on, dad! Look at her
in those shorts!

321
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,546
I just got puberty.

322
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:05,825
(Boys) Yeah.

323
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:08,344
Look on the bright side,
coach.

324
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:10,697
You also look good
in your shorts.

325
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,066
(Laughter)

326
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,080
See?

327
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,644
Positive reinforcement
doesn't really work.

328
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:19,239
(Whistle blows)

329
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:20,490
(Sighs)

330
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:29,708
How was practice?

331
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:30,788
Jackie made me cry.

332
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:33,270
Because she made me feel
so good about myself...

333
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,266
Which I do.
I feel really good about me.

334
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:37,562
You know, 'cause I'm making
such a difference, you know?

335
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:39,572
What about you?
How's the bake sale coming?

336
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,868
Awesome. Excellent.
Also making a difference.

337
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:45,168
With Larry Bird,
the P.T.A. is all mine.

338
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:46,873
Literally.

339
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,034
Yeah.

340
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:50,260
All right, well,
I'm gonna go take a shower.

341
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,452
I'm gonna go bake
the cookies.

342
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:52,717
But I feel really good
about myself

343
00:14:52,737 --> 00:14:54,455
- 'cause I'm making a difference.
- Well, I'm even gladder

344
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:57,020
that I'm making more
of a difference, so...

345
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,287
Jackie was right
about my thighs.

346
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:14,011
Where are the minions
to make our cookies?

347
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:15,677
I'm here to motivate
their labor.

348
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,324
The minions quit, Larry.
Every single one of 'em.

349
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:19,987
They all think you're
a dangerous lunatic,

350
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:23,065
- and I agree with them.
- Oh! Short-sighted fools.

351
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,422
They're obviously not
worthy of your leadership.

352
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:26,477
(Utensil clacking)
You're better off without them.

353
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:29,197
Well, I would disagree,
since now you and I...

354
00:15:29,217 --> 00:15:31,604
have to make
200 gingerbread cookies

355
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:33,957
by tomorrow morning
by ourselves.

356
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,546
What?

357
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:37,366
Oh, no, I can't.

358
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:40,667
I have a, um, a work thing
which I have to att...

359
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,472
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

360
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:47,084
- My cat just died.
- Sit.

361
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,807
Let's get cooking.

362
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:51,142
(Dick Butkus screaming and grunting)

363
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,637
(Gasps and grunts)

364
00:15:57,798 --> 00:16:00,301
(Inhales and exhales sharply)

365
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:03,521
Hey, Dick, what are you doing?

366
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,225
(Exhales)

367
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:07,501
I'm practicing so that
I might return to the team

368
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:08,860
and regain
my mother's respect.

369
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,075
So far, it's been
a total disaster.

370
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,088
Well, you know, sometimes
parents take sports a little too seriously.

371
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:16,000
And the truth is,
I think this might be

372
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,675
more about your mom
than you.

373
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:19,834
But you must admit,
by all metrics,

374
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,621
I am a pretty bad athlete.

375
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:23,445
Oh, the worst.
But that doesn't mean

376
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:25,202
that your mother
isn't proud of you.

377
00:16:25,222 --> 00:16:28,150
I think you're a lot like
she was at this age,

378
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:30,997
and sports really helped her
with her self-esteem.

379
00:16:31,017 --> 00:16:33,280
And she just wants
that same thing for you.

380
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,230
But I'm not lacking
self-esteem.

381
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,550
Why would I be?
I mean, look at me.

382
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,015
Who else do you think could
pull off this look?

383
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,229
Wow, not many.

384
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:44,197
You're a good kid, Dick Butkus.

385
00:16:44,346 --> 00:16:45,946
Why don't you go
get your uniform on?

386
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,902
We're gonna go get you
back on that team.

387
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:52,126
(Woman shouts indistinctly)

388
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:53,789
(Crowd cheering
and chanting indistinctly)

389
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:54,606
Two, four, six, eight!

390
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,659
Two, four, six, eight!
Two, four, six, eight!

391
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:01,334
Dick?

392
00:17:02,277 --> 00:17:04,215
(Cheering continues)

393
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:07,859
Win at all costs.

394
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,291
Be fierce.
Take no prisoners.

395
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,202
I don't miss my son at all.

396
00:17:13,704 --> 00:17:14,845
(Blows whistle)

397
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:17,085
Gingerbread cookies!

398
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:20,634
Help the soccer team
buy new uniforms.

399
00:17:20,654 --> 00:17:22,210
They're yummy.

400
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:25,486
They can't taste worse
than they look.

401
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:28,600
You know, in spite of everything,
I think this was quite a victory.

402
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,654
Do you? Do you, Larry?

403
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,886
We've sold zero cookies.

404
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:34,937
Alienated the parents
of all our kids' friends,

405
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:36,026
drove a woman crazy,

406
00:17:36,077 --> 00:17:37,411
and made the worst
gingerbread cookies

407
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:39,876
in the history of mankind.

408
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:42,167
So, why? Why, Larry?

409
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,468
Well, because I actually thought
you had some pretty good ideas

410
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:48,744
about arts programs
and teacher evaluation.

411
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:53,164
And if anyone ever asks,
I shall deny it, but...

412
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:55,353
If I had to have
a human woman

413
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:56,879
guiding
my children's education,

414
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:59,741
I'd be very happy
if it were you, Debbie Weaver.

415
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:02,024
You are a good human woman.

416
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:07,024
That is actually a very sweet
thing to say, Larry.

417
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:11,345
- Please don't be weird.
- No, you're weird.

418
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,748
- Okay, well, this is weird.
- It is.

419
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:17,859
(Boy shouts indistinctly)

420
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,410
Go, go!

421
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,706
Hello, coach mother.

422
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:25,199
Hello, son.

423
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,615
Marty, what are you
doing on my field?

424
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:29,618
You need to put Dick in the game.

425
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:30,772
No, I can't.

426
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:33,259
Oh, come on, Jackie.
This isn't you.

427
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,604
I know you're worried
about Dick's self-esteem,

428
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:38,334
but you don't have to be.
Dick is a great kid!

429
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:40,884
Look at him.
He's smart, he's compassionate.

430
00:18:40,904 --> 00:18:41,988
Huh? He's cute.

431
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:45,041
And once I learn a couple of bulletproof
"knock-knock" jokes,

432
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:47,374
- I'll be the total package.
- (Laughs) You see that?

433
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:50,130
I mean, I don't know
an adult who's that confident.

434
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,937
I just worry.

435
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:55,218
(Sighs) Kids can be so cruel
to unique children.

436
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:58,378
Although you are
really quite remarkable.

437
00:18:58,874 --> 00:18:59,631
(Laughs)
Okay.

438
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:02,254
("Adulthood" by Jukebox the ghost playing)

439
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:05,133
Here you go, buddy.
Put these on.

440
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,417
Ooh... (Sighs)

441
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:11,296
You are a good coach,
Marty Weaver.

442
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:13,629
- I'm okay.
- Mm.

443
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:16,161
Â™º I go outside

444
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:19,231
â™º Ask the air if it would
like to hide â™º

445
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:21,353
Nice try, Dick!

446
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,709
No, it wasn't.

447
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:27,190
Larry Bird!
Say something encouraging!

448
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,245
- Fine.
- Honestly.

449
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,937
- Your hair looks great, son!
- Yes!

450
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:34,949
- He gets that from you.
- Thank you. Yes, he does.

451
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:39,121
- Oh, God, he's terrible.
- I know.

452
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:42,941
Â™º No one survives
(Latch clicking)

453
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,329
Hey.

454
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:47,529
Can I buy a cookie?

455
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,348
I wouldn't. Unless you
like the taste of failure.

456
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:52,951
You know, this is why
we should do this stuff together,

457
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,653
because I think we make
a pretty good team.

458
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:56,938
Oh, come on.
We make a great team.

459
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:00,683
(Clears throat) You know, I've been told
that I'm a fantastic coach.

460
00:20:00,703 --> 00:20:03,538
(Crunches loudly) Well, I've been told
that I'm a pretty good human woman, so...

461
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:04,458
(Marty) Mm.

462
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:07,305
- How did you do it?
- Hi, Linda. Do what?

463
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:09,092
The gingerbread man...
it was alive!

464
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:11,537
I don't know how,
but it was alive.

465
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:14,279
You know, I think you're just stressed out
from the drama of everything.

466
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,758
There's no such thing as
a living gingerbread man, Linda.

467
00:20:16,778 --> 00:20:18,677
Oh. Really?

468
00:20:19,962 --> 00:20:21,146
(Jackie) Get the ball, Dick!

469
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,938
(High-pitched voice)
I'm running as fast as I can!

470
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:29,009
Aah!

471
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:31,844
She's a little jumpy.

472
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,925
Yeah, a little high-strung.

473
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:14,454
Ow!
