1
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,244
Everyone has a worst nlghtmare.

2
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,218
For some, lt's bathlng-sult season.

3
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:59,621
For others, lt's that your blrth certlflcate
can never be legally destroyed.

4
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:03,253
For Mlranda, lt was famlly hour at her gym.

5
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,088
What the....

6
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:15,872
Klddy Jazzerclse,
Aeroblcs Room 1, flve mlnutes.

7
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:20,904
On Sundays, her nelghborhood became
occupled terrltory under slege to chlldren.

8
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,208
They were everywhere.:

9
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,115
Movle theaters, restaurants,
bookstores, halr salons....

10
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,177
Starbucks was baslcally
a stroller parklng lot.

11
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:32,484
Was lt too much to hope
for one small space to call her own?

12
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,319
Don't touch it, pIease!

13
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,958
Is there a probIem?

14
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,967
No, it's just that
he reaIIy Iikes to push the button.

15
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,295
Fine, I'm in kind of a rush. Push One.

16
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,969
Simon, this pretty Iady said
that you couId push the button.

17
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,670
-So sorry.
-I'm sure it's just a phase.

18
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:59,246
Yeah, the guiIty, overinduIgent
phase of a D-I-V-O-R-C-E.

19
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,857
-Daddy.
-Simon, we're not being very nice to....

20
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:15,299
-That sounds Iike a princess name.
-Stop taIking.

21
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,438
I'm going to bite you.

22
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,907
-Do you want to go to the toy store Iater?
-Yes.

23
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,807
Then don't bite me.

24
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,707
I am in vioIation
of every parenting book ever written.

25
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,349
-Do you have kids?
-No.

26
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,579
Married?

27
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,855
-Here we are.
-At Iast.

28
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,160
Any chance I couId persuade you
to take another ride?

29
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,070
Hls name was Roger Cobb.

30
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:58,441
It only took hlm another floor and a half
to ask Mlranda for her phone number.

31
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,809
The whole thlng mlght have been
very romantlc...

32
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,973
...lf Slmon hadn't peed ln hls pants.

33
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,383
I don't wear vintage cIothes,
I hate fIea markets, I don't coIIect antiques.

34
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,650
Is it too much to ask that he not be,
I don't know, used?

35
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:15,091
Before it goes any further, just make sure
his parts are stiII under warranty.

36
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,230
-It's Iike chewing somebody eIse's gum.
-Divorced men do come with baggage.

37
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,927
Baggage is one thing.
But when they come with kids....

38
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,231
EspeciaIIy kids with bIadder controI issues.

39
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,769
Here's what I think.

40
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,966
Round up aII the divorced men
and keep them in a pound.

41
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:32,067
That way, you get their whoIe history
before you take one home.

42
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,807
If a man is divorced,
it doesn't mean he has a probIem.

43
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,146
Like my brother WesIey.
He just separated from his wife, LesIie--

44
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:44,354
-WesIey and LesIie? I don't think so.
-What is that, marriage by Mother Goose?

45
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,825
DefiniteIy a candidate for the pound.

46
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,421
I was going to ask you to meet him 'cause
he's coming to visit, and now forget it.

47
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,933
We want to meet WesIey
of WesIey and LesIie.

48
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,434
And p.s., does he work for NestIé?

49
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,801
My brother's very important to me.

50
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,603
I won't have him subjected
to scrutiny and ridicuIe.

51
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,810
-I'II be Scrutiny. You be RidicuIe.
-I aIways have to be RidicuIe.

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,711
Why can't you be RidicuIe for once?

53
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:10,771
I know.

54
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:15,143
As for me, rather than sort
through the half-off bln...

55
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,746
...I was datlng
someone brand-spanklng new.

56
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,393
I met Vaughn Welsel at a P.E.N. luncheon
a month ago.

57
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:24,997
It's amazlng how much better looklng
flctlon wrlters have become.

58
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,326
StiII up for a movie?

59
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,358
I just gotta drop these books
by my parent's pIace. It's on the way.

60
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,597
-GQ caIIed.
-They want you to write something?

61
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,699
They want me to wear something.

62
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,439
It's so great to be a writer these days,
there's so IittIe writing invoIved.

63
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,743
Don't be photographed
in anything sIeeveIess.

64
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,511
No one who went sIeeveIess
ever won a PuIitzer.

65
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,076
It's just a IittIe tip from me to you.

66
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,188
Nice townhouse.

67
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,761
-Come on in, this wiII onIy take a second.
-I'm not dressed for famiIy.

68
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,296
Can you just drop them
through the maiI sIot?

69
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,389
If I'm here and I don't say heIIo...

70
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,197
...I'm Iooking at two months minimum
hard famiIy time.

71
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,466
AII right. Yeah, okay.

72
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,365
Thank you.

73
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:13,173
Mother, I swear, you are the onIy person
who can kiII a cactus.

74
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:15,905
This is Carrie.

75
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:20,282
TeII your sister to stop bringing me pIants.
They get suicidaI around me.

76
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,913
I have to taIk them down from the Iedge.

77
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:28,056
-Those books you asked me to sign....
-Duncan, Vaughn's here.

78
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,691
And he brought a girI!

79
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,322
-Hi. WaIIis WeiseI...
-Hi.

80
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:37,569
-Have we met?
-No, I don't think so. Carrie Bradshaw.

81
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,570
My God. Duncan, get your ass in here.

82
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:45,168
I just Iove your coIumn.

83
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,506
I Iove to hear that.

84
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,482
-Mom, we can't stay.
-The heII you can't.

85
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,849
You know what you shouId write about?
Re-virginization.

86
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,851
Did you know there are women
who are actuaIIy having...

87
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,552
...their vaginas re-stitched
to make them Iike new again?

88
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,656
Aren't they cIever?

89
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,461
If you're wondering, Mom just finished
a documentary on genitaI mutiIation.

90
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,694
Which I stiII haven't gotten your notes on.

91
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,397
I toId you, I can't bring myseIf
to Iook at that thing.

92
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:17,307
And I typed aII his short stories for him
when he was 12. Duncan, Iook.

93
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,910
Do you know who this is?
Carrie Bradshaw.

94
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,642
-She writes that coIumn we Iove.
-What are you doing Thursday night?

95
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:25,884
Laundry.

96
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,612
I teach a seminar at CoIumbia
on CuIturaI Zeitgeist.

97
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,450
I'd Iove to have you come speak.

98
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,617
Mr. SeIf-InvoIved here
didn't teII us he was dating an icon.

99
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,890
-Icon?
-You are an icon. You are.

100
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,793
-Who brought a girI?
-This is my other sister.

101
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,563
Franny, this is Carrie.

102
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,328
-What's up?
-What's up?

103
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,963
-Hey, mom.
-Hi, sweetie.

104
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,799
Franny and Zooey?

105
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,170
What can I say?
J.D. SaIinger used to get me high.

106
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:57,214
And then she'd caII me at 3:00 a.m.,
''I Iove you.''

107
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,178
Good for you.
BeautifuI and she thinks I'm funny.

108
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,850
You're hiIarious. Put your tongue back
in your head and the Iox on the tabIe.

109
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,483
Come on, everybody,
Iet's have something to eat.

110
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:13,054
-We have to go.
-Come on, pIease.

111
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,266
We'II stay.

112
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,966
I mean, really,
wlthln the space of flve mlnutes...

113
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,770
...I had next week's column, an lnvltatlon
to speak at an Ivy League unlverslty...

114
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,904
...and access
to the entlre Zabar's flsh counter.

115
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,014
Leave now? Was he nuts?

116
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,683
Have you ever gone out
with someone who had a kid?

117
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,282
No, but I've never gone out with someone
I met on an eIevator either.

118
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,861
That's a first for me, too.

119
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,955
I met a woman on an escaIator once,
but it didn't Iast Iong.

120
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,626
It was over by the time
we got to Ladies Lingerie.

121
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,602
I dated a man once
who wore Iadies' Iingerie.

122
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,368
That was kind of the probIem there.
I'm kidding.

123
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,511
-'Cause I'm wearing panties now.
-You're kidding, right?

124
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,442
Look what I found.

125
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,746
-Can you say you're sorry?
-No!

126
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,046
Are you okay?

127
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,112
FortunateIy, I mostIy use
the right side of my brain.

128
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,523
It must be hard,
having a sociaI Iife as a singIe parent.

129
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,461
It is, I got to buy protective heImets
for aII my dates.

130
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,965
Where's mine, by the way?

131
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,768
The truth is, I didn't reaIIy have
a great sociaI Iife before Simon either.

132
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:34,038
I'm just one of those weird maIe
aberrations who prefers to be married.

133
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:40,175
I Iike stabiIity and routine. I Iike knowing
there's peopIe waiting for me at home.

134
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,318
-I guess that makes me sound pretty duII.
-Are you kidding?

135
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,358
You're the HeterosexuaI HoIy GraiI.

136
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,628
Mlranda wondered how a vlntage man
mlght look on her modern couch.

137
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:59,426
-Here.
-Thank you.

138
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,864
ProbabIy not the best time
to ask you to dinner.

139
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,442
Whlle Mlranda was deallng
wlth queaslness...

140
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,570
...Charlotte was handllng depresslon...

141
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,878
...whlch she felt could be solved
wlth a homemade muffln.

142
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,350
Here you go. Just Iike Nana used to make.

143
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,319
CharIie, the muffins are great,
but I'd much prefer a nice dry martini.

144
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,823
But Nana aIways made muffins
to cheer you up.

145
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:24,222
That was pre-LesIie. Post-LesIie,
I need a cocktaiI. Where's your vodka?

146
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,455
-I don't have any.
-And you caII yourseIf a Wasp.

147
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:32,434
I don't see why you two can't work it out,
you had the most beautifuI wedding.

148
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,438
We'II have an even IoveIier divorce.

149
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,136
I can't beIieve you're wiIIing
to just throw it aII away so easiIy.

150
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,271
ReIationships take work.
You need patience and understanding.

151
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,780
When was your Iast
Iong-term reIationship?

152
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,650
Just eat your muffin.

153
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,460
The afternoon had been
llke slx hours of foreplay.

154
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,342
Some men seduce
wlth dlm llghts and soft muslc.

155
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,573
Vaughn seduced
wlth chocolate chlp cookles and relatlves.

156
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,785
It was lnevltable thls would happen.

157
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,394
I just dldn't know
lt would happen so qulckly.

158
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,389
I'II get a tissue.

159
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,109
Get out now,
before he stains aII your sheets.

160
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,377
Come on, that's harsh.
It couId be he was just nervous.

161
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,917
First time is aIways weird.

162
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,580
-He probabIy had something to drink.
-We'd spent the day with his famiIy.

163
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,814
The guy couId not get
his CadiIIac into the garage.

164
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,826
I'm sorry, I hate being right about this.

165
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,295
Samantha was the General Patton of sex.

166
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,167
She dldn't send her troops
lnto battle lf she thought they would lose.

167
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,391
I Iike him.

168
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,402
That's sweII, but it doesn't
get the cream in the cupcake.

169
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,906
But the thing I Iike best about him
is his famiIy.

170
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,374
Anyone there you can fuck?

171
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,871
What? I'm trying to be heIpfuI.

172
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:25,507
I'm teIIing you, this famiIy is Iike....
They got charisma.

173
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,176
Like Tom Cruise,
they're the Tom Cruise of famiIies.

174
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,688
I'm sure the famiIy is supposed
to be the obstacIe to a reIationship...

175
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,054
...not the attraction.

176
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,593
I fucked a guy once
because his famiIy had a pooI.

177
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:40,261
He was pretty much of a nerd, but I'd go
over there and get aII cocoa-buttered up.

178
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,631
His mom Ioved me. She was aIways
serving me KooI-Aid and chips.

179
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,570
-KooI-Aid?
-Yeah, KooI-Aid, I was 13.

180
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,165
And honey, you shouId have seen my tan.

181
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,110
In my mlnd, the compllcatlons of maklng
a relatlonshlp work...

182
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,580
...had just expanded exponentlally.

183
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:01,314
When you date someone, how many
people become emotlonally lnvolved?

184
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:05,481
When you sleep wlth someone,
are you screwlng the famlly?

185
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,158
Whlle I was stlll on the fence
about Vaughn...

186
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,890
...I had no doubt about
my feellng for hls mother.

187
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,625
I was ln love wlth her.

188
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,829
Then we were in Nicaragua
with the Peace Corps.

189
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,798
That's where Vaughn was born.

190
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,238
I can't get over it. You've had five Iives.

191
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,305
I can bareIy make one happen.

192
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,241
Don't puII that seIf-effacing shit with me.

193
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,838
I see you. I know what you've got going.

194
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,647
What? What do I do?
I write this IittIe coIumn.

195
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,155
It's a contribution.
You are putting it out there.

196
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,855
You're part of a diaIogue.

197
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,416
If it wasn't for you...

198
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:47,124
...we wouIdn't know haIf the things we do
about other peopIe's sex Iives.

199
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,501
-Thanks a Iot.
-I'm teasing.

200
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:55,097
No, it's wonderfuI
to be frank and honest about sex.

201
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,871
That's how I raised my kids.
Sex was aIways a part of the discussion.

202
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:04,472
When they were 2 years oId, they knew
the proper names for their body parts.

203
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,882
None of this ''pee-pee''
and ''wee-wee'' crap.

204
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,480
And as a resuIt,
they can taIk to me about anything.

205
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,916
When Franny toId me she was a Iesbian...

206
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,995
...I said, ''Great, just as Iong
as you're not a RepubIican.''

207
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:23,996
-May I just say I Iike you very much.
-That's dear, thank you.

208
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,698
Did you taIk to LesIie today?

209
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,641
No. I taIked to her Iawyer.
Do you want to know about that?

210
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,770
I'm giving her the house
and she's giving me an uIcer.

211
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,407
I'm sorry I brought it up.
Tonight we'II have fun.

212
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,418
You'II finaIIy meet my friend Carrie.

213
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,954
We'II go out, have dinner,
maybe go to a cIub....

214
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:43,989
Shit.

215
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,029
This is my wonderfuI brother, WesIey.

216
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,503
-Nice to meet you.
-Good Iooks run in the famiIy.

217
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,002
-Can I get you Iadies a drink?
-CosmopoIitan.

218
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,130
Ditto.

219
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,436
-How are you enjoying New York?
-Excuse us.

220
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,843
Why is she here?

221
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,516
That's our friend.
I beIieve you remember Samantha.

222
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,751
You know how she gets.
Look! She's doing it aIready.

223
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,415
They're taIking.

224
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:27,096
Samantha says there's
a great jazz bar that we shouId go to.

225
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,466
-I just don't think I'm up for it tonight.
-Then maybe we'II just go.

226
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,372
TaIking and going to hear jazz.

227
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,878
I think I have your son's SIinky
embedded in my back.

228
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,915
I Iike to brand my women.

229
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,951
I'm going to use the bathroom,
and then I reaIIy wiII go.

230
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,127
-Daddy?
-No, Simon!

231
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,796
Daddy!

232
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,263
Shit.

233
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,107
I'm sorry. I was peeing,
and I didn't want him to see me.

234
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,207
I was afraid he'd see me...

235
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:22,812
...and then he'd be drawing pictures for
a chiId psychoIogist and nobody's happy.

236
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,948
-I'II get a Band-Aid.
-He's hurt. He might need a stitch.

237
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,785
-I'II go with you to the emergency room.
-No!

238
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,957
Just go.

239
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,664
PIease, just go.

240
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,498
One thlng about famllles...

241
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,734
...lf no one's sorry to see you go,
then you're probably not comlng back.

242
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,075
The next mornlng,
Charlotte was ln for a rude awakenlng.

243
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,180
Where do you keep your coffee fiIters?

244
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,745
Just teII me if I'm warm.

245
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,713
My brother? You sIept with my brother?

246
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,893
Honey, what a doII. He reaIIy--

247
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,495
Is your vagina
in the New York City guidebooks?

248
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:08,465
It shouId be, it's the hottest spot in town!
It's aIways open!

249
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,268
What's going on?

250
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,772
What did you say?

251
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,245
She was in my kitchen,
she was wearing your shirt, I snapped.

252
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:31,089
Who asked you to butt your nose
into my.... Samantha, wait! Don't go!

253
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,824
I didn't know your mom
was nominated for an Oscar.

254
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,728
Best Documentary Short.

255
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,901
I just Iove that she stiII has
so many ambitions for herseIf.

256
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,466
I'm not reaIIy in the mood
to taIk about my mom.

257
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,677
I'm not reaIIy in the mood to taIk at aII.

258
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,485
Don't touch it!

259
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,918
What was the documentary short
about anyway?

260
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,384
Good, you're back.

261
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,786
I swear to God, if you hand me a muffin,
I'm out of here.

262
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,531
You don't know Samantha. I do.

263
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:50,557
She has so many notches on her bedpost,
it's aImost whittIed down to a toothpick.

264
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,967
It was fun.

265
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,562
I know.

266
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,336
You had your IittIe fIing, now you can
go back to LesIie and work it out.

267
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,175
We're not working it out.
You think you know WesIey and LesIie?

268
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,439
Let me teII you about WesIey and LesIie.

269
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:08,180
LesIie's frigid and before Iast night,
WesIey hadn't gotten Iaid in two years.

270
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,352
-My God.
-I was going out of my mind.

271
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,482
I've seen a pastor. I've seen a shrink.

272
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:18,222
But untiI I saw Samantha,
I didn't reaIize what I reaIIy needed: sex.

273
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,192
-So it was a good thing.
-It was a frigging great thing.

274
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,665
That Samantha....

275
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,360
You've reaIIy got a good friend there.

276
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,072
It's CharIotte.

277
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,813
-That was a terribIe thing I said.
-Yes, it was.

278
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,488
If you'II excuse me...

279
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,892
...I have another tour group coming
through my vagina in 10 minutes.

280
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,260
I'm so sorry.

281
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,425
-You said what you came to say?
-Wait!

282
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,335
I wanted to give you this.

283
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,977
Samantha was touched.

284
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,141
She reallzed
thls was Charlotte's way of saylng...

285
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,783
''...Thank you for fucklng my brother.''

286
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,217
Get in there.

287
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,118
Hey, kldsI Funtastlcs on Three.

288
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:28,157
Mlranda declded she had ceded
enough terrltory to the lnvadlng troops.

289
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,766
Do you mind?
He reaIIy Ioves to push the button.

290
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,500
Yeah? So do I.

291
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,383
That is so sexy.

292
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,879
You in bed with my book.

293
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,183
It's reaIIy great.

294
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:01,127
-Do that again.
-What, turn the page?

295
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,328
Baby.

296
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:10,730
Again.

297
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,740
Wait, stop.

298
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,316
Let's just take this nice and sIow.

299
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:29,483
You teII me if you're feeIing too excited
and we'II take a IittIe break.

300
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,756
Why?

301
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,756
Because I think we both
reaIIy want this to work.

302
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,332
I Iove that you get so turned on by me...

303
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,474
...and I am very turned on by you.

304
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,580
Maybe we've just been
in too much of a rush.

305
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,614
-Forget it.
-No, I don't want to forget it. Come here.

306
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:00,287
-Let's taIk about it.
-No! I don't want to taIk about it.

307
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,316
I think we have to.

308
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:06,323
Why does everything have to be about sex!
I am so sick of taIking about sex.

309
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,992
I've been taIking about it since I was 2.

310
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,062
So Iet's go.

311
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,431
My parents are expecting us.

312
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:21,702
Duncan and I went down to
the NeiI Simon Theater and spent $65--

313
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,804
$75.

314
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,142
To see a British movie star
simuIate a bIowjob.

315
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,876
I wonder if that's what NeiI had in mind.

316
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:33,691
-Did she show her tits?
-No. How's the pickIed herring?

317
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,559
It's very good.

318
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,790
Franny teIIs me that you two
are going camping this weekend.

319
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:43,457
-Where's the scaIIion cream cheese?
-It's out there on the tabIe.

320
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,697
I don't see it.

321
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,566
Then check the refrigerator.

322
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,575
-Why is he so edgy?
-I have no idea.

323
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,742
-Don't Iet him puII that moody shit on you.
-I know. It's such a pose.

324
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,582
Since he got pubIished,
he's suddenIy this tortured artist.

325
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,884
-Where's the cream cheese?
-It's out there.

326
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,200
Why buy this shit if you can't remember
the one thing that hoIds it aII together?

327
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:26,235
Let's deaI with what's reaIIy upsetting you.
ShaII we?

328
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,910
If everything's on the tabIe, why don't we
start with some scaIIion cream cheese?

329
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:39,319
Jenna and I looked at each other
llke two forelgners wlthout vlsas.

330
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:47,461
You know what, I think I'd better go.
I've got a deadIine.

331
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,538
I'II go. Thank you for Iunch, for everything.

332
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,915
What happened?
Everything was going so weII.

333
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,880
It reaIIy wasn't.

334
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,720
I know what it is.
His Iast girIfriend wasn't as discreet.

335
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,661
I don't want to get in the irony.
He writes short stories.

336
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,932
This has officiaIIy become too weird.

337
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,162
ReaIIy, in a situation Iike this,
you gotta Iaugh.

338
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:32,140
AII right, it's a probIem.
But you'II work it out.

339
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,573
He won't even taIk about it.

340
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,909
-You want me to taIk to him?
-No.

341
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:46,382
-I can't discuss this with you.
-You can! You and I can discuss anything.

342
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,920
So your sex Iife isn't so great. So what?

343
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,523
Seventy-seven percent
of aII marriages are sexIess.

344
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,830
Other things are so much more important,
Iike famiIy.

345
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:04,135
Then I saw that the person I really
had to break up wlth wasn't Vaughn.

346
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,938
It was hls mother.

347
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:12,446
I wouId stiII Iike us to be friends.
No, I mean that.

348
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,243
And what happens
when you meet somebody eIse?

349
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,788
I can teII you now, they won't have
a mother Iike me. You know that.

350
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:26,456
You know that we have something.
What we have is very speciaI.

351
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,230
AII right, weII.

352
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,699
CaII me sometime.

353
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,543
-I wiII.
-Sweetie.

354
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,848
Wallls was rlght. The most
lmportant thlng ln llfe ls your famlly.

355
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,752
There are days you love them,
and others you don't.

356
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,727
But ln the end, they're the people
you always come home to.

357
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,264
Sometlmes lt's the famlly you're born lnto.

358
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,994
And sometlmes lt's the one
you make for yourself.

359
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,202
-What are you doing here?
-Come here.

1
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,611
欲望城市

2
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,671
（性爱专家凯莉布雷萧）

3
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,467
’缺点’

4
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:54,853
每个人都有噩梦
有些人的噩梦是穿泳衣

5
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,515
有些人的噩梦是知道
自己的出生证明不能被销毁

6
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,287
对米兰达而言
她的噩梦是健身房的家庭时间

7
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:16,204
儿童爵士舞，有氧舞蹈教室
再五分钟开始

8
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:21,109
每个周日
整个社区都被儿童包围

9
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:25,273
到处都有他们的踪迹：
餐厅，书店，美容院

10
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,249
星巴克变成婴儿推车停车场

11
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:32,892
拥有属于自己的小空间
太奢求了吗？

12
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:38,688
-拜托，不要乱碰
-有甚么问题吗？

13
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,696
他喜欢按按钮

14
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,062
我在赶时间，按一个就好？

15
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,740
这位漂亮的小姐说你可以按

16
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,408
-很抱歉
-我确定这只是阶段性的

17
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:59,051
因为离婚感到罪恶而宠坏小孩

18
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:08,189
-爸爸
-这样很不礼貌，你是…

19
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,886
-米兰达
-米兰达？

20
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:15,433
-像公主的名字
-不要说话了

21
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:22,330
-我要咬你
-想不想去玩具店？

22
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,065
那就不要咬我

23
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:30,615
所有育儿书上写的折磨
我都受过

24
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,314
-你有小孩吗？
-没有

25
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,716
结婚了吗？

26
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,588
-到了
-终于

27
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,388
我能说服你再搭一次吗？

28
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,938
他叫做罗杰科伯

29
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,474
搭了一层楼半他才问出
米兰达的电话

30
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:03,172
要是赛门没有尿裤子
一切都很浪漫

31
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:07,251
我不穿复古服饰，不收集古董

32
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:11,219
问他是否被「用旧了」
会不会太过分？

33
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,053
只是为了确定他「那里」
还可以用

34
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,252
那就像吃别人嚼过的口香糖

35
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:21,559
-离婚的男人有拖油瓶
-他们带来了小孩

36
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,326
有尿失禁的小孩

37
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:28,905
把所有离婚男子集中起来
关在一起

38
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,305
在接受他们之前先打听好
他们的过去

39
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,513
不代表他有问题

40
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,911
我弟弟卫斯理刚和他太太
蕾丝李分居

41
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,816
卫斯理和蕾丝李，不会吧？

42
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,615
怎么？鹅妈妈故事里的人物？

43
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,122
绝对是集中营的候选人

44
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:51,229
我本来想邀你们跟他见面
现在算了

45
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,628
我们想跟「蕾丝李的老公」
卫斯理见面

46
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,199
他在「耐司礼」公司工作？

47
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,335
我弟弟对我很重要

48
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,237
我不希望他被人观察和奚落

49
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,810
我会观察他，你会奚落他

50
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:11,313
-你有时候也要懂得奚落别人
-我知道

51
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,947
与其在旧恋情中浮浮沉沉

52
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,588
我有新的约会对象了

53
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,222
我在作家俱乐部餐会上
认识方恩怀佐

54
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,794
今日的作家都变的比较好看了

55
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:29,594
-还要去看电影吗？
-我得送东西到我父母家

56
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,571
-GＱ杂志打电话给我
-他们邀你写作吗？

57
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,969
他们邀我参加服装秀

58
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,339
今日的作家都不写作了

59
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,571
不要穿著无袖拍照

60
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:48,220
穿无袖的都不会得普立兹奖
我给你的一个小告诫

61
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,887
-很棒的房子
-进来，我一下子就好

62
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:58,257
我穿这样不好见你家人
你不能投到信箱里吗？

63
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,958
我要是不进去打声招呼
我会有两个月不好过

64
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,397
好吧…

65
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,641
妈，我发誓你是唯一
能杀死仙人掌的人

66
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,939
-方恩
-左伊，这是凯莉

67
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,617
叫你妹妹不要再带植物给我了

68
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:23,221
它们不断地想自杀
我得劝它们远离架子旁

69
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,415
-你要我签名的书
-太棒了

70
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,424
-唐肯，方恩在这里
-他带了一个女孩

71
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:37,469
-华莉丝怀佐，我们见过吗？
-没有吧，凯莉布雷萧

72
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,936
天，唐肯，快进来

73
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,871
我好爱好爱你的专栏

74
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,308
-我好爱好爱听到别人这么说
-妈，我们不能久留

75
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,646
为甚么不能
你应该写写处女膜再造术

76
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,788
有些女人到医院

77
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:01,426
把处女膜再缝合，变回处女

78
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,527
真聪明，是不是？

79
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,291
妈才刚完成一部
生殖器毁损的纪录片

80
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,233
-我还没有收到你的笔记
-我没办法看那种东西

81
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,908
我在他十二岁时帮他
写了他的小故事

82
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,772
唐肯，你知道这位是谁吗？
凯莉布雷萧

83
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,506
-写专栏的
-你星期四晚上要做甚么？

84
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,707
洗衣服

85
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,220
我在大学教授文化思潮
我想请你演讲

86
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:35,417
「自顾自」先生没有告诉我们
他在跟偶像约会

87
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:39,621
-你真的是个偶像
-谁带女孩来了？

88
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,461
这是我另一个妹妹弗兰尼
这是凯莉

89
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,297
-怎么了？
-怎么了？

90
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,871
弗兰尼和左伊？
（美国作家沙林杰的作品）

91
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,011
我能怎么办？
我以前太迷沙林杰了

92
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:57,046
她会半夜三点打给我说
我爱均KA

93
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,051
他觉得我很好笑

94
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,486
你极为可笑
不要长舌了，吃东西吧

95
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,387
来吧，我们吃点东西

96
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,653
我们得走了

97
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,758
-我们可以留下来
-太好了

98
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:21,702
就在这短短五分钟内
我想出下礼拜专栏的内容

99
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,308
受邀到大学演讲

100
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,241
到扎巴餐厅大啖鱼类美食

101
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,541
现在离开？他疯了吗？

102
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,583
你曾和有小孩的人约会吗？

103
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,749
没有，我也没有跟在电梯
遇到的人约会

104
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,522
我曾在电扶梯遇到一个女孩
但不多久就吹了

105
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,030
到了女内衣部门就分手了

106
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:54,205
我曾和一个穿女人内衣的
男子约会，他有问题

107
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,671
-开玩笑的
-我现在穿著短内裤

108
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,637
你开玩笑的吧？

109
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,911
-爸爸，你看这个
-快说对不起

110
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,881
你还好吗？

111
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,215
幸运地，我通常用右脑思考

112
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,458
单亲父母的社交生活
一定很艰难

113
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:24,568
-我得帮约会对象买头盔
-我的在哪里？

114
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,036
赛门出生以前
我的社交生活也不怎么样

115
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,870
我是个脱离常轨的怪人

116
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,104
宁可结婚

117
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:40,342
我喜欢稳定，有规律
喜欢有人等我回家

118
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,154
-我听起来很无趣
-说甚么傻话

119
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,521
你是异性恋中的圣杯

120
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,355
米兰达在想一个中古男人
在她现代家具上的样子

121
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,637
-你看，给你
-谢谢

122
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,841
现在邀你吃晚餐或许不是时候

123
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:08,105
当米兰达努力克制恶心的同时
夏绿蒂在赶走沮丧

124
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,340
她认为可以用手工松饼解决

125
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,348
就像奶妈以前作的一样

126
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,284
松饼好吃，但我宁可要马丁尼

127
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,685
奶妈都会做松饼替你打气

128
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,157
那是以前的我
我现在需要鸡尾酒

129
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,556
-你的伏特加在哪里？
-我没有

130
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:30,498
-你是新教徒吗？
-你们有甚么事不能解决？

131
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,035
-你有一场很美丽的婚礼
-我们的离婚更可爱

132
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,108
我不敢相信你就这样轻易丢开

133
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,270
一段感情需要耐心和体谅

134
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,678
你最近一次最长的关系
是甚么时候？

135
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,287
吃你的松饼吧

136
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,994
那个下午就像历时
六小时的前戏

137
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,809
有些男人用烛光和轻音乐
引诱女人

138
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,375
方恩用饼乾和家人引诱我

139
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,386
发生这种事无可避免

140
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,656
我只是没料到会这么快

141
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,064
我去拿面纸

142
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,637
在他弄脏你床单之前甩了他

143
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,750
-或许他很紧张
-第一次总是很奇怪

144
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:57,116
-可能是喝酒的关系
-我们整天跟他的家人在一起

145
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:02,818
那家伙的车开不进车库
真讨厌被我说中

146
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:08,968
没有胜算的话
莎曼珊不随便派兵

147
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,328
我喜欢他

148
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,970
他们不会在杯子蛋糕加奶油

149
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:18,506
-我最喜欢他的家人
-有可以上床的人选吗？

150
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,770
我试著帮你忙

151
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,383
他的家人…很有魅力

152
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,109
就像汤姆克鲁斯

153
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,814
家人应该是一段感情的阻碍
不是吸引

154
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:37,519
我曾因为某人家有游泳池
跟他上床，结果他是个笨蛋

155
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,894
我会到他家帮忙打奶泡
他妈妈爱死我了

156
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,069
-她拿多果汁给我喝
-多果汁？

157
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:50,004
我当时十三岁
你应该看看我古铜色的皮肤

158
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,806
成功经营一段感情是不容易的

159
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,039
现在以指数方式持续复杂化

160
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,879
当你跟某人约会时
有多少人在感情上受到影响？

161
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:06,457
当你跟某人上床
是不是等于跟他全家做爱？

162
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,820
在我还不确定
我对方恩的感觉时

163
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:13,431
我确定我喜欢他的母亲
我爱她

164
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,658
我们当时在尼加拉瓜
参加和平部队

165
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:21,805
-方恩就是在那里出生的
-你救了五条生命

166
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,134
我不可能做得到

167
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:31,715
不要轻视你自己
我知道你会有所作为

168
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,545
我能做甚么？
我不过写个小专栏

169
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,019
那就是贡献，你写文章

170
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,715
你是对话的一部分

171
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:45,625
要不是你，我们就不会知道
其他人的性生活

172
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,329
-非常谢谢你
-我在取笑你

173
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:55,003
能这样诚实地谈论性真的很棒

174
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:59,871
我就是这样养育小孩的
性教育是我们的话题之一

175
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,175
两岁时，他们就知道
身体各器官的正确名称

176
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,841
从来没有甚么小鸡鸡小鸭鸭的

177
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,615
所以，他们可以跟我说任何事

178
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,418
当弗兰尼跟我说她是同性恋

179
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,188
我说：很好
只要你不是共和党员

180
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:21,889
我可不可以说我很喜欢你？

181
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,261
你真是个甜心，谢谢你

182
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,200
-你有跟蕾丝李说话吗？
-没有，我跟她律师谈过

183
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:34,640
我要把房子给她
她却给我胃溃疡

184
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,839
很抱歉我又提起

185
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,646
今晚我们来放松
凯莉会过来吃晚餐…

186
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,686
可恶

187
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,459
凯莉，莎曼珊…

188
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,292
这是我的好弟弟，卫斯理

189
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:59,494
-很高兴见到你
-你们家族都长得很好看

190
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:03,640
-你们女士要喝点甚么？
-四海为家

191
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,504
-你喜欢纽约吗？
-容我们私下谈一下

192
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,779
她为甚么在这里？

193
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:14,316
那是我们的朋友
你还记得莎曼珊吧？

194
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,650
你知道她那副德行
她已经开始了

195
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,883
他们在说话

196
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,293
莎曼珊说有一个
很棒的爵士酒吧

197
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:30,059
我今晚没那个心情

198
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,429
我们就去吧

199
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,936
聊聊天，听听爵士乐

200
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,940
我的背后有你儿子的娃娃

201
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,517
我喜欢把我的女人贴标签

202
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,014
我去一下洗手间就走

203
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,272
-爸爸
-不要，赛门

204
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,235
-赛门
-可恶

205
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,469
抱歉，我在上厕所
不希望他看见我

206
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,979
我怕他会看见我

207
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:22,745
就不得不去看心理医生了

208
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,890
-我去拿OK绷
-他可能要缝针

209
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,117
我跟你去急诊室

210
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,556
你走吧

211
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,666
拜托，走吧

212
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,502
要是在一个家庭里
没有人在乎你是否离去

213
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,231
你或许不用再回来了

214
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:47,411
隔天早上夏绿蒂被吵醒

215
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:52,641
你咖啡滤纸放在哪里？告诉我

216
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,512
你跟我弟弟睡觉？

217
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:01,853
亲爱的，你真可爱
我是说，他真的很…

218
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,461
你的阴道有没列入旅游书中？

219
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:08,599
那可是曼哈顿最热门的据点
而且全年开放

220
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,532
怎么了？

221
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,448
-你说甚么？
-她穿你的衣服

222
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,552
-我突然间…
-谁要你多管闲事…

223
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,086
莎曼珊，不要走

224
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,853
我不知道你妈妈
得过奥斯卡提名

225
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,760
最佳短篇纪录片

226
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,698
我喜欢她这样胸怀抱负

227
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,565
我不想谈我妈妈

228
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,476
我根本不想聊天

229
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,290
不要碰它，不要碰

230
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,882
那部短篇纪录片有多「短」？

231
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,680
很好，你回来了

232
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,919
我发誓，要是你再给我松饼
我马上走人

233
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:48,032
你不了解莎曼珊
她的床柱使用过度

234
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,326
都快磨成绣花针了

235
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,161
很幽默

236
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,565
你玩也玩过了

237
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,071
现在可以回到蕾丝李身边
把事情解决

238
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:03,306
我们没有办法解决
你以为你知道我们的问题？

239
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:08,077
蕾丝李很严肃，昨晚以前
卫斯理已经两年没做过爱

240
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,620
-我的天
-我简直快疯了

241
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,758
我跟牧师谈过，看过心理医生

242
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:18,521
直到我遇见莎曼珊
我才知道我需要的是「性」

243
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,222
-所以那是件好事
-是一件很棒的事

244
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:26,199
莎曼珊…真的是个好朋友

245
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,478
夏绿蒂

246
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,081
-我说的话很过分
-一点也没错

247
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,728
抱歉，还有一个旅行团
要到我的阴道参观

248
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,023
-我真的很抱歉
-你要说的都说了？

249
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,201
等一下

250
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,361
我要给你这个

251
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,668
-莎曼珊很感动
-过来

252
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:13,682
那是夏绿蒂向莎曼珊说：
谢谢你跟我弟弟上床

253
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,717
进来

254
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,754
小鬼，游乐室在三楼

255
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:28,826
米兰达觉得她不想再退让了

256
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,903
你介意吗？他喜欢按按钮

257
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,268
是吗？我也是

258
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,383
好性感

259
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,511
你跟我的书在床上

260
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,090
真的很棒

261
00:19:56,828 --> 00:20:01,026
-再一次
-甚么？翻页吗？

262
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,403
宝贝…

263
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,006
再一次

264
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,413
等一下，停

265
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,213
我们慢慢地来

266
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:30,157
要是太兴奋就告诉我
我们可以休息一下

267
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,886
为甚么？

268
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:35,624
因为我觉得我们都希望能成功

269
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,429
我是说…

270
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,504
我喜欢你因我「性」致勃勃

271
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,871
我也因你热情如火

272
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,639
或许我们太急了

273
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:52,316
算了

274
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,884
我不想算了，过来

275
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:00,047
-我们来谈谈
-我不想谈

276
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,489
我们必须要谈

277
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:06,494
每件事都跟性有关
我不想再谈到性

278
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,667
我从两岁就开始谈论性

279
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,736
我们走吧，我爸妈在等我们

280
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,677
我们去看尼尔赛门的戏剧

281
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,642
-花了六十五块
-七十五

282
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,942
看一个英国演员假装口交

283
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,484
我不知道那是不是尼尔的原意

284
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:33,647
-她有露奶子吗？
-没有，腌鲱鱼好吃吗？

285
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,417
很棒

286
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:39,620
弗兰尼说你们周末要去露营

287
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,461
-奶油起司在哪里？
-在桌子那边

288
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:48,471
-我没看到
-看冰箱里有没有

289
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,373
-他为甚么这么急躁？
-我不知道

290
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,274
不要让他的情绪化影响你

291
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,281
只要他一出书
就会变成痛苦的艺术家

292
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,449
-奶油起司在哪里？
-在外面

293
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,964
要是不知道东西放在哪
何必买这么多鬼东西？

294
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:26,337
方恩，我们来解决
让你烦心的事，好吗？

295
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,412
如果你希望把东西都拿到桌上

296
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,981
可以先拿青葱奶油起司

297
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:39,616
珍纳和我相视
就像两个没有签证的外国人

298
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,355
我得走了

299
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,692
我要赶稿子

300
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:56,201
我要走了
谢谢你的午餐和一切

301
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,814
发生了甚么事？一切都很好

302
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,583
-不，不好
-我知道是怎么回事

303
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:19,492
他的前女友没有这么谨慎
他写短篇故事

304
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:24,401
这下子真的变得太奇怪

305
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,104
在这种情况下，只能傻笑

306
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:32,242
好吧，那是个问题
不过你们一定能解决

307
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,678
他根本不愿意谈

308
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,646
-你要我跟他说吗？
-不要

309
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,744
我没有办法跟你谈这个

310
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:46,947
你跟我甚么都可以谈

311
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:54,429
你的性生活不美满又怎样？
有七成的婚姻都是无性的

312
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:59,002
其他的事更重要，例如家庭

313
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,373
我发现我要分手的不是方恩

314
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,010
而是他的母亲

315
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:12,582
我希望我们还是朋友，说真的

316
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,310
要是你遇见别的人呢？

317
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,752
他们不会有我这样的母亲

318
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:26,490
你知道我们是独一无二的

319
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,662
好吧，那么…

320
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,441
-有时间打给我
-我会的

321
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,475
亲爱的

322
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:50,385
华莉丝说的对
生命中最重要的是你的家人

323
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,252
有时候你爱他们
有时候则不然

324
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,519
但他们永远是你的依靠

325
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,027
有时候是你出生的那个家庭

326
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:04,259
有时候是你自己组的家庭

327
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,341
你在那里做甚么？
