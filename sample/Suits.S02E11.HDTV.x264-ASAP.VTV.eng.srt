00:00:01,553 --> 00:00:03,622
When I was 11,
my parents were involved

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,257
in a really horrible accident.

4
00:00:05,325 --> 00:00:06,258
My grandmother took me in.

5
00:00:06,326 --> 00:00:07,626
It's your grandma.

6
00:00:07,694 --> 00:00:09,027
She passed away.

7
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:11,563
Either Jessica will retain
her position,

8
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:13,799
or I will resume control
of Pearson Hardman.

9
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:16,902
I'm entitled to name
one new senior partner a year.

10
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,572
If you are on the wrong side,
there'll be no coming back.

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,275
The managing partner
is Daniel Hardman.

12
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:25,210
Jessica lost!
You lost!

13
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:27,559
Are you looking for another
way to make my life miserable?

14
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:29,455
Zoe, I'm still not convinced
I should hire you.

15
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:31,316
Well, Harvey never tried
to sleep with Ted Phillips.

16
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:32,651
Ms. Sheila Sazs.

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,087
I think Louis is attracted
to female Louis.

18
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:36,989
- I'm Tess.
- You guys must go way back.

19
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:39,291
First beer, prom, sex.

20
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,226
Your grandmother just died.

21
00:00:41,294 --> 00:00:42,327
When something
like that happens,

22
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:44,263
people don't make
smart choices.

23
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,998
- You're married.
- And you called me anyway.

24
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:47,933
What if Hardman planted
the CM memo

25
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:49,368
in the first place?

26
00:00:49,436 --> 00:00:51,436
All those in favor
of Daniel Hardman's dismissal...

27
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:53,672
[Knock on door]

28
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,209
I don't care
about being smart.

29
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:14,393
[Laughs]

30
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:17,029
Fyi, we're out of pizza.

31
00:01:17,096 --> 00:01:18,797
You're telling me this now?

32
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:21,099
I didn't know
you were gonna get high.

33
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,634
You mean you didn't know
<i>we</i> were gonna get high.

34
00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:25,571
Oh, does this mean you're
not going back to work tomorrow?

35
00:01:25,638 --> 00:01:27,506
No, it means I'm celebrating
going back to work tomorrow.

36
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:29,208
Fine.

37
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:31,076
But don't think I don't know
what you're really doing.

38
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:33,445
What, getting you high,
so I can get into your pants

39
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:35,614
or under your sheet
or whatever?

40
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:37,249
I meant you're afraid.

41
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:39,685
Afraid? Nope.

42
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:41,987
I'm not afraid,
I can't wait to get back.

43
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:44,423
You can't wait to get back
to talk to Rachel?

44
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:47,192
I am not afraid
to talk to Rachel.

45
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,894
And I'm not afraid
of the big, bad wolf.

46
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:50,629
Look, I told you,
she's a friend.

47
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:52,931
She was just coming
to check up on me, that's all.

48
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,366
And I told you
I believed you.

49
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:56,535
You're welcome.

50
00:01:56,603 --> 00:01:59,104
So why can't you just keep
pretending you believe me now?

51
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:03,642
Because you have
to go back to work tomorrow.

52
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,580
And your husband gets back
in town tomorrow.

53
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:09,848
- You want more pizza?
- Let's order more pizza.

54
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,818
- Yeah.
- Great.

55
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:30,769
Somebody give you
a promotion?

56
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:32,571
Somebody should.

57
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,841
Lopez buyout delayed,
Phillips merger closed.

58
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,944
Oh, and Zoe Lawford called,
which is odd,

59
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:40,512
because I don't remember us
having a trial

60
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,347
we needed
consulting services on.

61
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:43,615
So that's why you're sitting
at my desk.

62
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:44,750
I wanted to be
in a position of power

63
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:49,054
when I toyed with you.

64
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:50,289
Let's get one thing clear.

65
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:51,924
I'm not Charlie Brown,

66
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:53,859
you're not Lucy,
and that's not a football.

67
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:55,761
Let's get
two things clear.

68
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:58,597
I don't remember
ever placing a call to Zoe,

69
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:00,899
but her message said
she was calling back.

70
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:03,101
I called her.
For business.

71
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:05,938
What kind of business?
A merger?

72
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:07,406
Okay, what are you,
12 years old?

73
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:08,440
I'm not the one
robbing the cradle here.

74
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:09,808
I'm not robbing anything.

75
00:03:09,876 --> 00:03:11,476
Zoe and I are the same age.
So you admit it.

76
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:12,784
You called to ask her
on a date.

77
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:14,379
Behind my back.
It wasn't behind your back.

78
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:15,781
You'd gone home already.

79
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:16,949
Because you waited
for me to go home.

80
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:21,320
Like I said,
it was behind your back.

81
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:23,589
Harvey,
just out of curiosity,

82
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:25,924
what took you so long
to call her?

83
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:27,426
I had my hands full
with Hardman.

84
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:29,227
Well, now you're hands full
of her.

85
00:03:29,295 --> 00:03:30,963
Look, now it's over,
I want to celebrate.

86
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,397
And she's the person
I want to do it with.

87
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:34,466
Are you gonna tell her that?

88
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:36,134
I assume you heard

89
00:03:36,202 --> 00:03:37,102
that the Lopez buyout
was delayed?

90
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,437
So I'm gonna need some--

91
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:39,771
Louis, I don't give a shit
what you need.

92
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,006
All right, Harvey,
you know what?

93
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:42,608
Look, it's been a week.

94
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:44,776
You won, you know,
get over it.

95
00:03:44,844 --> 00:03:45,944
Get out.

96
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:47,312
You know,
for your information,

97
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,348
I wasn't the only senior partner
who voted for Hardman.

98
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:50,415
And I don't see you giving
anyone else shit

99
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:51,683
the way you give me.

100
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:53,485
And by the way,
when the chips were down,

101
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:55,087
I backed you,
I ousted him.

102
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:59,658
You mean
when you did this?

103
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:00,659
Tell yourself
whatever you want, Louis,

104
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:03,562
but tell it to yourself.

105
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:19,478
You here
to rip the band-aid off?

106
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:23,015
It's what grammy always said
to do when you have a boo-boo.

107
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:24,316
Really?

108
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:28,420
You're gonna use her
to get out of this?

109
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:30,455
Look, Rachel, I understand
that you're mad at me.

110
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:32,491
No, I'm not.

111
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:33,992
What's that expression?

112
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,293
"Fool me once,
shame on you.

113
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:36,962
Fool me twice--"

114
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,296
nobody's fooling anybody.

115
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:40,532
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

116
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,967
For what I saw
or what you did?

117
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:43,402
Rachel, come on.

118
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:44,803
I'm just trying to--
let me just ask you this.

119
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,405
Does she know that six hours
before you screwed her,

120
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:49,274
you tried to screw me?

121
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:51,943
Okay, let's not pretend
that this is about her, okay?

122
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:53,845
So she knows,
or she doesn't?

123
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:55,113
I mean, is it fair to her

124
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,481
that she was your second choice
that night?

125
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:59,418
Because if I were her, Mike--
She's married.

126
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:00,519
I don't think
she's really worried

127
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:06,091
about being
my second choice.

128
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,859
Welcome back.

129
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,294
Who's ready
for a great first day?

130
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:10,862
Harvey, can you give us
a minute, please?

131
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,698
I can't.
We actually have a crisis.

132
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:14,232
We gotta go.

133
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,535
Come on.

134
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:19,805
[Clears throat]

135
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:27,946
You once told me
you could fix anything, Harvey.

136
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:29,915
This is my son, Liam.

137
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:34,252
Your mother says
you have a problem.

138
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,090
Um, I was driving home
from Greenwich last night.

139
00:05:38,157 --> 00:05:40,859
A friend's party.

140
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:44,129
I hit someone.

141
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:45,363
I-I didn't see him.

142
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:46,865
He came out of nowhere.
Were you drunk?

143
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:48,500
Don't answer that.

144
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:50,902
If this comes to trial,
I can't put him on the stand.

145
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,270
But I wasn't drinking.

146
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:53,438
And if we asked everybody else
at the party,

147
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:55,373
would they tell
the same story?

148
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,542
If it comes out,
we need to know.

149
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,444
Talk to anyone
who was there.

150
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:01,880
What if I checked your car
for beer bottles right now?

151
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:03,815
Go ahead.
Check anything you want.

152
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:05,450
I'm telling the truth.

153
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:08,620
Okay, it was an accident.
We can deal with this.

154
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:13,291
Tell me, what happened
to the guy you hit?

155
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:15,627
I don't know.

00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:02,161
but one wrong question
and I'm out?

175
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,163
You weren't jumping the gun,
it set you off.

176
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,698
Harvey, I'm fine.

177
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:07,133
Look, I'm not blaming you,
I'm understanding you.

178
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:09,101
Your parents were killed
by a drunk driver.

179
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,137
- And Liam said he wasn't drunk.
- Doesn't matter.

180
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:12,538
Your emotions get
the better of you on a merger.

181
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:14,240
Gillian's a longtime client.

182
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,242
It's her only son,
I can't have that.

183
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,710
I can do this.

184
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:20,780
Your grandmother
just died.

185
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:22,582
I said I'm onboard.

186
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:25,585
I'm onboard.

187
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:32,091
So what do you think?

188
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,193
The damage helps us.
It's minimal.

189
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:37,663
More importantly,
if the impact was central,

190
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,499
guy would have been directly
in your field of vision,

191
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:42,668
so this backs the story up.
He came out of nowhere.

192
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,037
Albert Chung was rushed
to the E.R. last night,

193
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:47,106
after a 911 call.

194
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,242
- You called 911?
- Yeah.

195
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:50,710
You should have
told us that.

196
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:53,045
He has a concussion,
contusions, four cracked ribs,

197
00:07:53,113 --> 00:07:54,313
but he's stable.

198
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:56,148
Thank God,
so it's okay.

199
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:58,417
Gillian,
Liam needs to turn himself in.

200
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:00,219
It was an accident.

201
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:02,288
Exactly,
so if he comes forward,

202
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,456
he's a 20-year-old kid
who freaked out,

203
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,323
but now he's doing
the right thing.

204
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:05,625
Harvey's right.

205
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:07,159
If they come to us,
which I know they will,

206
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:09,395
we'll be on the defensive,
we'll never recover.

207
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:10,997
- Shit.
- You can't know that.

208
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:12,632
They might never find him.

209
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,467
You really want to risk
your son's life on that?

210
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:18,471
I'm sorry,
but isn't this Liam's decision?

211
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,580
- What's gonna happen to me?
- I don't know.

212
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:29,482
But if you're worried
about prison movies,

213
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,050
that's not
what's gonna happen.

214
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:32,218
How do you know that?

215
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,620
Because I know Harvey.

216
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:35,922
I don't know.

217
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,990
I don't know.

218
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,726
Hey, believe it or not,

219
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:42,461
I've been where you are
right now.

220
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:44,430
What?

221
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:46,699
Yeah.
I was 16.

222
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:50,937
Got busted for possession,
1/2 ounce.

223
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:52,044
[Chuckles]
I was so scared.

224
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:54,206
You smoke?

225
00:08:54,274 --> 00:08:57,777
I did.

226
00:08:57,844 --> 00:09:00,613
I do.

227
00:09:00,681 --> 00:09:02,715
But you
didn't hurt anybody.

228
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,617
I know it feels
like there's no way out.

229
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:05,885
But I'm telling you,

230
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:09,689
you're going to be home
in time for dinner.

231
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:16,162
I must say,
I'm so glad you called.

232
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:19,231
- I'm so glad you answered.
- I'm glad you're glad.

233
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:21,219
When were you gonna tell me
about your promotion?

234
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:22,435
You know
about my promotion?

235
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:24,070
Senior partnerships
rocket to my ears

236
00:09:24,137 --> 00:09:25,438
with the speed
of a late-night bullet.

237
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:27,306
- Really?
- I read it on Twitter.

238
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:28,574
From the moment
I laid eyes on you,

239
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:30,076
I could tell
you were a baller.

240
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:32,745
Oh, I ball,
which is why I called you.

241
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:34,714
One of the perks
of my new title--

242
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:36,115
Say it.

243
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:38,317
[Whispering]
Senior partner.

244
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:39,452
Go on.

245
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,321
I get to hire
an associate of my own.

246
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,357
A Boy Wonder
to my Batman.

247
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:45,825
Well, I am with you,
Dark Knight.

248
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:47,360
I want you
to send me the best of the best.

249
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:48,667
I've already
lined up interviews

250
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:50,016
with my top five
recent graduates.

251
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,565
- Have you?
- Figure of speech.

252
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,300
But, I have to say,
I was hoping you didn't call

253
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:56,235
exclusively for business.

254
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,837
I was hoping
you were hoping that.

255
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:59,304
I'm gonna be honest
with you, Louis.

256
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,007
Senior partner has
a certain sex appeal

257
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:02,508
junior partner doesn't.

258
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:07,780
I thought that
to myself about myself.

259
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:09,448
Room 405.

260
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:11,050
9:00 p.m. tomorrow.

261
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:16,522
Bring coconut oil,
a ski mask, and duct tape.

262
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,995
[Whispering]
Fear never felt so good.

263
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:28,401
Katrina Bennett.

264
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:32,138
- Harvey Specter.
- Nice to meet you.

265
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:34,140
Your record is something
of a legend around here.

266
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:35,675
Excellent.

267
00:10:35,742 --> 00:10:38,077
I hope we can extend each other
some professional courtesy.

268
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:39,478
I'm not extending you
anything.

269
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:40,880
Of course.

270
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:43,149
What better thing to do
than to take down a legend?

271
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:44,583
Well, I'm glad
we understand each other.

272
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:47,119
We do,
but here's the problem.

273
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:48,754
This isn't the case for it.

274
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,890
It's a misdemeanor,
leaving the scene,

275
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:52,892
and now
he's turned himself in.

276
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,727
Because you knew
we'd trace the 911 call.

277
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:56,729
That's not why.
He feels terrible.

278
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:57,963
He feels afraid.

279
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:59,298
Not the same thing.

280
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:01,000
Katrina, I understand
you want to take me out,

281
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:02,568
but this is an accident.

282
00:11:02,636 --> 00:11:04,670
Liam made a mistake,
and he's rectifying it.

283
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,505
We'll accept
maximum community service

284
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:08,374
and whatever fine
you deem appropriate.

285
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:10,009
And what
about funeral costs?

286
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:11,444
Wait. What?

287
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:13,612
He died?

288
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,114
Which makes it
felony hit-and-run.

289
00:11:15,182 --> 00:11:16,949
He was stable.

290
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:18,184
His concussion led
to a brain bleed.

291
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:20,252
That man's death
doesn't change the fact

292
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,654
that it was an accident.

293
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,456
Felony hit-and-run,
under these circumstances,

294
00:11:23,523 --> 00:11:25,691
is 12 to 15 years.

295
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,260
You wanted courtesy?
Here it is.

296
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:29,895
I'll go ten.

297
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:32,031
That's crazy.
It was dark.

298
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:33,866
He wasn't drinking.

299
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:39,338
Tell me it's not
what you would have offered.

300
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:45,782
Maria Monroe.

301
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,370
Secretary of your class
at Harvard Law.

302
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:49,836
Clerked
for Chief Justice Roberts.

303
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:52,272
Glowing letters
of recommendation.

304
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,842
You think this impresses me?

305
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,110
Negative.

306
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:58,211
Which means you have
exactly five minutes

307
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,846
to convince me
that you're the one.

308
00:11:59,914 --> 00:12:02,316
I don't need five minutes.
I am the one.

309
00:12:02,383 --> 00:12:04,351
It's you who's on the clock,
Louis.

310
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,987
I have standing offers from
the top three firms in the city.

311
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:08,488
Pearson Hardman
is a top-three firm.

312
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:09,890
Well,
I used to think so.

313
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,425
But if it's taking you this long
to meet with me,

314
00:12:11,492 --> 00:12:12,960
maybe you're slipping.

315
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:15,028
Oh, no, I'm not--
[Stammers] We're not slipping.

316
00:12:15,096 --> 00:12:17,197
You need to submit
a formal offer by noon tomorrow

317
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:19,433
if you want me
to even consider working here.

318
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,002
Wh-- Maria,
hold on a second.

319
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,005
Just wait right there,
wait right there.

320
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:26,640
You four, beat it.

321
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,242
Position has been filled.

322
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,744
I'll beat any salary by 50%.

323
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:31,912
25,000 signing bonus.

324
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,414
- Put it in writing.
- W-w-w--

325
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:36,516
don't you want me
to give you a tour of the firm?

326
00:12:36,584 --> 00:12:37,864
Show you
where you'll be working?

327
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:39,086
Well, I don't care
where I'd be working

328
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:40,320
because I'm a machine.

329
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:42,556
I have to have you.

330
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,825
That's what they all say.

331
00:12:44,892 --> 00:12:47,561
Police report,
photos of the intersection,

332
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:48,762
coroner's report.

333
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,163
This isn't sixth-grade math.

334
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,732
Don't show me your work,
just give me the answer.

335
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,834
God, I wish I had you
in the sixth grade.

336
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:56,203
Except, no--
Miss Jenson, very hot.

337
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,704
You need a minute alone?

338
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:02,142
There was a reason that Liam
did not see Albert Chung.

339
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,579
He was wearing a hooded
sweatshirt, jeans, and sneakers.

340
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:07,047
All black.

341
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:08,715
Guy couldn't have been harder
to see if he was trying.

342
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:09,950
Maybe he <i>was</i> trying.

343
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:12,119
Albert Chung was
an art school dropout.

344
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:14,221
Look at that graffiti
on the wall.

345
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:16,156
"A.C."
Albert Chung.

346
00:13:16,224 --> 00:13:17,224
He was trying
to be invisible

347
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,525
because he was tagging
that building.

348
00:13:18,593 --> 00:13:20,160
And he was running away
when he got hit.

349
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:21,561
Which means
Liam didn't cause the accident,

350
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:23,063
Albert Chung did.

351
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:25,499
I think you missed
your calling as a fake cop.

352
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,768
Going back to that well again?
Okay.

353
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,636
So what are you gonna do?
Stick it to Katrina?

354
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:30,804
No, <i>you're</i> gonna stick it
to Katrina.

355
00:13:30,872 --> 00:13:32,139
You heard her.

356
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:34,508
Her agenda isn't
just prosecuting Liam,

357
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:35,642
it's beating me.

358
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,230
See, I'm taking
the personal out of it.

359
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:39,746
Your problem is,
you put the personal into it.

360
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:40,847
Okay,
I thought my problem

361
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:42,682
was showing you my work
unnecessarily.

362
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,584
Who said
there's only one problem?

363
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:47,521
Well played.

364
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:51,425
Felony hit-and-run hinges

365
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:53,727
on a lack
of contributory negligence.

366
00:13:53,795 --> 00:13:55,395
Albert Chung was fleeing
a crime scene.

367
00:13:55,463 --> 00:13:56,730
He put himself
in harm's way.

368
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:59,299
So your client
can't be held responsible?

369
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:00,200
We'll plead to misdemeanor
leaving the scene,

370
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:01,701
but that's all.

371
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:04,738
I'm going to do you a favor
and take this deal.

372
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:07,441
You're not doing me a favor,
you're doing yourself a favor.

373
00:14:07,508 --> 00:14:08,542
We've got you.

374
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:10,043
Got me or not,
it's no secret

375
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:11,978
the D.A. and Harvey had
a run-in.

376
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:13,407
He finds out
this is Harvey's case,

377
00:14:13,448 --> 00:14:14,581
it goes to trial.

378
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:16,349
And anything can happen
at trial,

379
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:17,684
so let me be clear,

380
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:20,687
I am doing you a favor.

381
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:22,155
What do you want?

382
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:24,424
To make the same career jump
Harvey did.

383
00:14:24,492 --> 00:14:25,892
To corporate litigation?

384
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,893
To Pearson Hardman.

385
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:28,695
Wait, I thought you--

386
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:30,664
That I wanted
to kick Harvey's ass?

387
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:31,832
I said that
because you don't impress

388
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:33,600
a lawyer like Harvey
with flowers.

389
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:37,070
Look, this is a fair plea.

390
00:14:37,138 --> 00:14:38,438
And it's one
that should go through.

391
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:40,140
I'll make sure
that it does.

392
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,042
And if you were
to put a word in with Harvey,

393
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,980
I would appreciate it.

394
00:14:47,048 --> 00:14:48,148
You got
to be kidding me.

395
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:49,583
She actually said that?
Yeah.

396
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,385
I don't know if I settled a case
or agreed to a bribe.

397
00:14:52,453 --> 00:14:54,121
- Did she sign the plea offer?
- Yeah.

398
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:56,756
Then, "A," because she
can't rescind that thing

399
00:14:56,824 --> 00:14:58,792
unless new evidence
comes to light,

400
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,127
and I don't have
to interview her for shit.

401
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:02,062
- Good.
- Yeah, good.

402
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,331
I don't want to hire
another associate ever again.

403
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:06,600
The one I picked
causes me enough headaches.

404
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,034
Oh, right,
like winning cases?

405
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:10,637
Graffiti, man in black--
is that ringing any bells?

406
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:12,005
It does indeed,

407
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:14,241
which leads us
to our next assignment,

408
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:15,742
should you choose
to accept it.

409
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,244
Please tell me
you're about to self-destruct.

410
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:21,448
We need to settle
with the Chung family.

411
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:23,250
Harvey,
their son just died.

412
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:26,219
I know, and I also know
that grief comes in stages,

413
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:28,121
and the best time to settle
is before it gets to anger.

414
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:29,923
You mean the best time
to take advantage of them

415
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:31,291
is before it
gets to anger.

416
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,293
- That's not--
- Our concern?

417
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:35,195
I know we got Liam
out of prison,

418
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:37,564
but he still hit a guy,
and that guy is still dead.

419
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,232
And we still
represent Liam.

420
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,301
Harvey...

421
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:44,171
I know it's not
the same situation, but...

422
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:48,041
I remember the day
the lawyer came to our place.

423
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:50,076
Nick Rinaldi.
I...

424
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:52,746
I remember his dirty shoes.
I...

425
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:54,253
I remember
how they scraped the floor

426
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:55,515
when he walked
into the living room

427
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,816
to tell my grandmother

428
00:15:56,884 --> 00:16:00,687
how much my parents' lives
were worth.

429
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:03,223
I've been
where these people are.

430
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,560
Let me be the one
to tell them.

431
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:08,228
You sure
you can handle it?

432
00:16:08,296 --> 00:16:09,396
I'm sure as hell
not going

433
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:10,363
to leave them
to the likes of you.

434
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:14,067
Okay,
you can handle it.

435
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:17,237

Look, I know
that you're mad at me,

438
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:40,093
and I never meant
to put you in this situation,

439
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:41,795
but I would
really appreciate it

440
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:43,897
if you kept what I told you
to yourself.

441

Let me get this straight.

442
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,934
You hit on me,

443
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:50,337
then you run into the arms
of some married woman,

00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:51,972
you come waltzing
into my office

trying to cutesy your way
out of it,

446
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,808
and now you have the nerve

447
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,845
to think I'm gonna go
and tell other people?

448
00:17:00,481 --> 00:17:01,848
[Box hittable]

449
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,617
I have no idea what
you're gonna tell other people,

450
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:04,751
but you sure seem
to have the ability

451
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,620
to judge everything
that I do.

452
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:08,421
Do you think that you have
the lock on bad decisions?

453
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,129
All I know
is I'm not little miss perfect.

454
00:17:10,157 --> 00:17:13,526
I've had
an affair before too.

455
00:17:13,594 --> 00:17:15,495
You see the look
on your face?

456
00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:17,030
Who's judging who now,
Mike?

457
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:19,699
And, no, it was not
some 50-year-old man

458
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:22,102
trying to take advantage
of poor, young me.

459
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:27,574
We were the same age,
and I went after him.

I am not the goody-goody
you think I am.

You have no idea
what you passed on.

And I'll tell you something,
Mike.

463

What you're doing,
it only ends one way.

464
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:52,684
Ms. Chung,
I just want you to know

465
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:55,788
that Liam Colson is devastated
by this accident,

466
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:57,723

467
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,325
Thank you.

I know that there's
no amount of money

that can ever
make up for it...

470
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:06,532
and that this is
probably the last thing

471
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,067
you want to be talking about.

00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:11,203
My brother wasn't exactly

We know he's not entitled
to much.

474

All my parents want is
to pay off Albert's debts

and cover
the funeral costs.

476
00:18:18,712 --> 00:18:20,679

00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:42,020
Safe words are for pussies.

521
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:43,088
Start with my slippers.

522
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:44,756
Oh, thank you.

523
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:48,694
[Gasps]

524
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:51,597
[Knocks on door]

525
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:59,471
- Hello.
- Where are your flowers?

526
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:00,973
My flowers?

527
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,475
You go on a date, you're
supposed to bring flowers.

528
00:21:03,543 --> 00:21:06,778
- Am I?
- Yes, Harvey.

529
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:08,413
Everyone knows that.

530
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:10,516
How many dates
have you been on?

531
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,651
- Six.
- Six?

532
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:15,454
Mm, sounds serious.
Who's the lucky guy?

533
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:17,389
Jason.

534
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:19,491
He's not a guy,
he's a boy.

535
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,826
And he brings flowers.

536
00:21:20,894 --> 00:21:22,227
[Laughs]

537
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:24,730
Well, maybe next time
we can have a double date.

538
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:26,131
You that sure
it's gonna go well tonight?

539
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:28,300
Olivia,
why don't you go upstairs

540
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:30,068
and finish watching
your show?

541
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:31,977
Is there maybe something
you forgot to tell me?

542
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:33,605
You mean
about your daughter?

543
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:36,074
See, that's funny
because we never slept together.

544
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:37,609
I don't find it funny
in the least,

545
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:39,645
and by "it," I mean
that we never slept together.

546
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:43,348
Seriously, Harvey,
I'm really sorry about this.

547
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,984
Olivia's my niece.
My brother just dropped her off.

548
00:21:46,052 --> 00:21:47,133
He didn't have
anybody else.

549
00:21:47,187 --> 00:21:48,954
Then I guess
we'll have to sit down,

550
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:50,789
watch Bugs Bunny,
and order a pizza.

551
00:21:50,857 --> 00:21:54,059
[Laughs]
Bugs Bunny?

552
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:56,161
Yeah, no one
watches that anymore.

553
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:58,390
I thought <i>Apocalypse Now</i>
would be a little much for her.

554
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:02,568
Can I come in?

555
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:05,604
Hey.
Thanks for starting without me.

556
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:08,307
- Couldn't wait.
- That bad a day?

557
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:11,476
Mm, nope,
that good of one.

558
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:12,945
So your little chat
with Rachel went well.

559
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:15,514
Not what I meant.

560
00:22:15,582 --> 00:22:17,649
I negotiated a settlement
with the sister

561
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:19,985
of the man who was killed
in a car accident today.

562
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:21,787
Oh, my God.

563
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:23,188
No, no.
It's not what you think.

564
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:24,523
I, um,

565
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:26,592
I gave this family dignity.

566
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:31,029
And as hard as it was...

567
00:22:31,097 --> 00:22:34,499
It was the best day of work
I've ever had.

568
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,368
That's awesome.

569
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:40,739
Yeah.
[Cell phone vibrates]

570
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,040
Hey.

571
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:44,042
Liam's plea deal
came through.

572
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,510
It's on its way
to Gillian's.

573
00:22:45,578 --> 00:22:47,618
I need you to go over there
and walk 'em through it,

574
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,647
so we can wrap this up.

575
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:50,482
Uh, I'm on my way.

576
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,284
Sh.
What?

577
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:54,219
I have to go see a client.

578
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:56,555
Mike, you're high.

579
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:59,658
What if they can tell?

580
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:01,693
Tess, I was high every day
of my life for years,

581
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:03,028
and nobody knew, okay?

582
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:06,331
[Hands clap]
I can handle it.

583
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,433
- She asleep?
- Not exactly.

584
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:10,502
She wants you to go up there
and kiss her good night.

585
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,670
[Laughs]

586
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:13,772
You don't have to do this.

587
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,174
- No, I can do that.
- Harvey.

588
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:17,803
Afterwards, I want you
to come down here

589
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:20,646
and kiss me good night.

590
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:30,022
So...

591
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:34,593
I sign this,
and we're done?

592
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:37,029
Um...yeah.

593
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:38,997
Uh, the A.D.A. agreed to it,

594
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:42,301
so you sign it,
and then, um...

595
00:23:42,368 --> 00:23:44,469
and then the judge will sign it.

596
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:48,140
[Voice breaks] And then--
then we're done.

597
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:49,641
[Sighs]

598
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:52,878
[Sighs]

599
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:54,646
[Sighs]

600
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:58,150
Community service
and a fine.

601
00:23:58,217 --> 00:24:00,052
You sound disappointed.

602
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,888
No, no,
I appreciate it.

603
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:05,357
It's just...

604
00:24:05,425 --> 00:24:07,125
It could have been
so much worse.

605
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:09,127
I thought
my life was over.

606
00:24:09,195 --> 00:24:11,530
I'm such an asshole.

607
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:14,933
Hey, Liam,
it's okay to feel relief.

608
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:16,802
The Chung family
doesn't blame you.

609
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:19,871
Nobody blames you.

610
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:21,239
Do you remember
what you said the other day

611
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:24,609
about getting high?

612
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:28,847
[Laughs]
Um, why are you asking me that?

613
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:32,384
I was high.

614
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,782
What?

615
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:39,291
[Sighs]

616
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,827
How could you
not tell us that?

617
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:43,562
'Cause Harvey
said not to.

618
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:44,563
But you said
you weren't drunk.

619
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,764
You said, "ask everyone."

620
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:46,765
You could have.

621
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,467
I was alone.

622
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:50,769
I get high all the time,
and no one ever knows.

623
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:54,406
- Oh, my God.
- What's the matter?

624
00:24:54,474 --> 00:24:56,775
You said
this was a done deal.

625
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:59,244
It is, right?

626
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:02,814
Yeah.

627
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:05,984
Yeah, it's a done deal.

628
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:18,719
- We got a huge problem.
- Don't worry, Mike.

629
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,223
I'm sure 'Nsync
will tour again someday.

630
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,659
We can't submit this deal
because it wasn't an accident.

631
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:25,926
It was a DUI.

632
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:27,361
- What?
- He was stoned.

633
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:30,364
This changes everything.
It changes nothing.

634
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:31,912
I misrepresented the facts
to Katrina.

635
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:33,234
No, you didn't,

636
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:34,669
because you didn't know
because we didn't ask.

637
00:25:34,736 --> 00:25:37,638
And I didn't ask now,
but he told me now.

638
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:39,426
And that's privileged,
and the deal is done.

639
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:40,941
Wait a minute,
so you're not gonna do anything?

640
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:43,377
I'm gonna have Donna messenger
this to the D.A.'s office.

641
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:45,780
Harvey, this family thinks
their son is to blame.

642
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:47,682
Because he was fleeing
the scene of a crime,

643
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:49,817
which put him in harm's way.
Okay, maybe.

644
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:51,246
But if I don't tell them
this part,

645
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:52,987
then I'm no different
than Nick Rinaldi.

646
00:25:53,055 --> 00:25:54,355
- You're already different.
- What do you mean?

647
00:25:54,423 --> 00:25:56,490
I mean, they were ready
to take the $20,000,

648
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:57,925
but you gave 'em $100,000.

649
00:25:57,993 --> 00:25:59,160
Did you think I wasn't going
to find out about that?

650
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:00,728
Harvey, please, come on.

651
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:02,296
You asked me
to be on this case

652
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:04,498
after I warned you
about something like this.

653
00:26:04,566 --> 00:26:06,100
You said, "I'm onboard."

654
00:26:06,168 --> 00:26:07,702
Do you have any idea
what would happen

655
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:08,803
if Gillian found out
what you did?

656
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,738
What if she found out
about her son?

657
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:12,206
She'd probably give them
a bigger settlement.

658
00:26:12,274 --> 00:26:14,975
But, hey, you already did that,
and I let it go.

659
00:26:15,043 --> 00:26:17,378
You need to let this go.
Say whatever you want.

660
00:26:17,446 --> 00:26:18,579
That's no different
than Nick Rinaldi,

661
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:22,416
that's just more money
and cleaner shoes.

662
00:26:28,657 --> 00:26:29,857
Oh, my God.
You were waiting.

663
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:31,425
I heard you were here,
so I rushed right out.

664
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:33,427
I formally accept
your offer

665
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:35,463
of employment
at Pearson Hardman.

666
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,364
Oh, this is
the best week ever.

667
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:38,799
I won't let you down.

668
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:40,134
I'm sorry.

669
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:41,936
I have no idea
what this is regarding,

670
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:44,405
but, yes, he will.
He always does.

671
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:46,540
- Water off a snail's back.
- See what I mean?

672
00:26:46,608 --> 00:26:49,510
Donna Paulsen, Maria Monroe,
my personal first-year.

673
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:51,612
- Oh.
- She's a machine.

674
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,847
And let me
just tell you something,

675
00:26:52,914 --> 00:26:54,248
she's gonna run circles
around Mike Ross.

676
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:56,250
You wait right here,
and I'll get us some bundt cake.

677
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:58,385
I'm sorry, Mike who?

678
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:00,254
- Mike Ross.
- Is he a first-year?

679
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:01,555
Why do you ask?

680
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:03,190
I thought you only hired
from Harvard.

681
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:05,760
- We do.
- I was secretary of my class.

682
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:07,161
I knew every name.

683
00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:09,463
There was no Mike Ross
my year at Harvard.

684
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:11,632
But you weren't
the same year.

685
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,968
No, I clerked
for a year.

686
00:27:14,035 --> 00:27:15,156
He's a year
ahead of me here,

687
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,370
but he would have been
in my class.

688
00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:18,672
Oh, well, Mike clerked
for three years,

689
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,407
which means
he wasn't in your class.

690
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:23,677
Well, I look forward
to meeting him.

691
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:33,554
Uh...last night.

692
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:35,556
I was, uh...

693
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:36,891
I was driving home,

694
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,426
I'd had a lot to drink.

695
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:42,163
I hit someone.

696
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,932
And I'm pretty sure
that they're dead.

697
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,504
So, uh,
I need your help.

698
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:52,640
Sorry,
I don't take cases like that.

699
00:27:52,707 --> 00:27:54,275
You don't take cases
like that?

700
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:56,944
What about your case
from 1992?

701
00:27:57,012 --> 00:27:58,312
Driver plows into a car,

702
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,314
after drinking
about a thousand jack and cokes,

703
00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:01,782
killing
a happily married couple?

704
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,851
James and Nina Ross?

705
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,559
I'm afraid
I have no recollection of that.

706
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,755
Oh, yeah? Let me ring
a bell for you, then.

707
00:28:07,823 --> 00:28:09,523
Two days later, you walk
into their living room,

708
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:11,492
you find their little boy
and his grandmother

709
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,529
just sitting there,
and then you stick it to them.

710
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:18,499
They hadn't even had time
to hold a wake yet.

711
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:19,934
Are you still
gonna deny it?

712
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,368
I didn't deny it,

713
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:22,636
just have
no recollection of it

714
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:25,005
because I did it
so many times.

715
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:27,274
I'm sorry, is that
supposed to move me, huh?

716
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:28,642
Am I supposed to think

717
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,511
that you're somehow
above all that now?

718
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:32,546
It's not supposed
to do anything.

719
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:33,714
But let me point out,

720
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:35,143
you walked in here
two minutes ago,

721
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:39,186
told me you'd hit somebody,
and I turned you away.

722
00:28:39,254 --> 00:28:41,689
[Sighs]

723
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:45,092
- What's your name?
- Like you give a shit.

724
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:47,594
Okay.

725
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:49,930
What are you looking for
from me?

726
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:52,099
I want to know
how you live with yourself.

727
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,000
I want to know
how you wake up every morning

728
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,302
and not put a bullet
in your brain,

729
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,537
knowing what a piece of shit
you are!

730
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,973
You might not want
to hear this.

731
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:01,575
But just because I
don't remember who you are

732
00:29:01,642 --> 00:29:03,944
doesn't mean I don't regret
what I did to you.

733
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:05,645
Now the sad fact is
that once a deal is done,

734
00:29:05,713 --> 00:29:06,713
it can't be undone.

735
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:11,551
James and Nina Ross.

736
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,353
If I ever see you again,

737
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:16,189
you better remember
who they are.

738
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:23,463
Thank you.

739
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:26,266
Did you know Louis
is hiring his own associate?

740
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:28,335
Not specifically,
but he is entitled to it.

741
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:29,636
We got to stop him.

742
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:31,738
Harvey,
I know you're mad at Louis.

743
00:29:31,806 --> 00:29:33,173
So am I,
but it's over.

744
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:35,242
We won, and the man
has a job to do.

745
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:39,546
That's not
what I meant.

746
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:41,948
We let him hire the person
he just hired,

747
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,050
Mike's gonna be exposed.

748
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:45,352
How do you know this?

749
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,220
She was secretary
of his class.

750
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:48,488
And there's 600 kids
in that class.

751
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:51,425
Nobody knows everybody.
She says she does.

752
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:53,994
- How can you be so sure?
- Donna met her.

753
00:29:54,061 --> 00:29:55,095
She's sure.

754
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:57,063
Goddamn Mike Ross.

755
00:29:57,131 --> 00:30:01,134
He's the gift
that keeps on giving.

756
00:30:01,202 --> 00:30:06,139
How many more headaches is
this kid gonna cause me, Harvey?

757
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:11,011
You wanted
to see me?

758
00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:14,147
Did you make an offer
to a Maria Monroe

759
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:15,449
to be
a first-year associate?

760
00:30:15,516 --> 00:30:16,583
Yes, and let me
just tell you something,

761
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:18,652
you're gonna love her.
Rescind it.

762
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:20,687
- What?
- Firm's been through a lot.

763
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:22,022
We have to regroup.

764
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:24,291
Therefore, I'm instituting
a hiring freeze,

765
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:25,598
which you
would have known about

766
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:27,093
had you come
and asked my permission first.

767
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,528
Okay, you can't do this.

768
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:29,863
I'm a senior partner,
and that's the rule.

769
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:31,298
Strictly speaking,
it's not a rule,

770
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:32,566
it's a tradition.

771
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:33,967
I get it.

772
00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:36,236
Strictly speaking, this
isn't about a hiring freeze,

773
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:37,437
this is punishment.

774
00:30:37,505 --> 00:30:40,907
You can be punitive,
I can be punitive.

775
00:30:40,975 --> 00:30:42,375
The offer already went out,
Jessica.

776
00:30:42,443 --> 00:30:44,311
You're a lawyer,
make it go away.

777
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:45,578
What am I gonna tell
the world?

778
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:47,013
I'm gonna look
like a freaking fool.

779
00:30:47,048 --> 00:30:50,217
Well, tell them
there's a hiring freeze.

780
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:52,018
I don't care.

781
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:55,255
Make it go away.

782
00:30:57,124 --> 00:31:00,293
You're dismissed.

783
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,334
The message you left
was a little cryptic.

784
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:09,302
What do you want?

785
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,538
I want to help you get
what you want.

786
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:13,773
And what is that?

787
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,308
Liam Colson was driving
under the influence

788
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:17,878
when he hit Albert Chung.

789
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:19,513
How exactly did you come
to know that?

790
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,315
I can't tell you that.

791
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:24,351
- Thank you, Mike.
- Yeah.

792
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:25,585
All rise

793
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:29,589
for the honorable judge
Nicholas Palermo.

794
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:30,857
Be seated.

795
00:31:30,925 --> 00:31:36,563
"State of New York
versus Liam Colson."

796
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:38,098
I am happy to report

797
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:39,366
the state entered
into a plea agreement

798
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:40,600
with the defendant
last night.

799
00:31:40,668 --> 00:31:45,472
You have a copy
of the terms, Your Honor.

800
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,340
Everything appears
to be in order.

801
00:31:47,408 --> 00:31:48,708
The agreement
is approved.

802
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:53,046
Community service
starts Monday.

803
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:54,714
That's it?
You're just walking away?

804
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:56,283
As fast as I can.

805
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,352
Because you know what "I can't
tell you how I know that" means?

806
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,453
It means
you just violated privilege.

807
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:01,721
Wait, so you don't care

808
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,557
that he was driving
under the influence?

809
00:32:03,624 --> 00:32:04,891
I can't prove
he was under the influence.

810
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,192
You don't know
what you could prove

811
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,661
if you got that kid
in a room.

812
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:09,129
If I were to use
what you just told me,

813
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:10,997
all I would be doing is making
myself look like an idiot.

814
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:14,234
Are you really gonna be able
to sleep at night?

815
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:15,802
Are you?

816
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,671
You're the one
who walked in there

817
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:20,240
and tried
to sell out a 20-year-old kid.

818
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:22,242
He took someone's life,
right?

819
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,945
That someone had a mother
and a father and a sister.

820
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:27,047
That family
is never gonna be the same.

821
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:29,783
Listen to me,
you think I haven't had a case

822
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,885
where I could have crossed
a line to put someone away?

823
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:33,920
[Laughs] I wouldn't
be surprised if you did,

824
00:32:33,988 --> 00:32:35,288
after that bribe
you offered me.

825
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:37,958
I didn't offer you shit.

826
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:39,492
I did you a favor.

827
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,395
And then I asked for a favor,
which you could do or not.

828
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:43,563
Is that really
what you tell yourself

829
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:44,864
when you look
in the mirror?

830
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:47,200
If you're willing
to break privilege,

831
00:32:47,268 --> 00:32:50,837
you're the one who needs
to look in the mirror.

832
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:05,919
Katrina Bennett called.

833
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:07,921
The deal's done.

834
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:12,158
Get the paperwork started.

835
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:14,294
Harvey,
what did you do?

836
00:33:14,362 --> 00:33:18,832
I did
what I had to do.

837
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:20,900
Your first hire
was Mike.

838
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:22,936
Are you sure you want this
to be your second?

839
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:24,638
I don't want
to hear it.

840
00:33:24,705 --> 00:33:28,541
She starts on Monday.

841
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:47,413
Chateauneuf-du-pape,
1985.

842
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:50,017
I guess they were out
of the '83.

843
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:52,819
Louis,

844
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:55,254
you look like I just kicked you
in the stomach

845
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:57,123
but in a bad way.
I'm sorry.

846
00:33:57,191 --> 00:33:59,992
I, uh...
my mind's on something else.

847
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,995
What is it?

848
00:34:03,063 --> 00:34:05,097
Promise
you won't be mad?

849
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:08,401
You're not about to tell me
I have to get tested, are you?

850
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:10,536
What? No.
Nothing like that.

851
00:34:10,604 --> 00:34:11,904
I...

852
00:34:11,972 --> 00:34:13,906
I had to rescind the offer...

853
00:34:13,974 --> 00:34:17,009
to Maria.

854
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:18,744
You're mad?
No.

855
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:21,914
I'm disappointed.
Sheila...

856
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:23,983
You're not the man
I thought you were.

857
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:26,185
I--I didn't have
a choice.

858
00:34:26,253 --> 00:34:27,720
It was
Jessica Pearson's decision.

859
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:28,855
Okay, well,
then I must have read you wrong

860
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:29,956
'cause I thought you were

861
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:31,190
a strong, powerful
senior partner.

862
00:34:31,258 --> 00:34:32,592
I am.

863
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:35,561
The evidence suggests
otherwise.

864
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:39,599
I think you should go.

865
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:41,400
Sheila, please.

866
00:34:41,468 --> 00:34:44,837
I mean, can't this snafu
just be something we laugh at,

867
00:34:44,905 --> 00:34:46,272
like, in an hour and a half,
hour and 45 minutes?

868
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,608
Your sexual prowess
isn't gonna get you out of this.

869
00:34:48,675 --> 00:34:50,109
- You are mad.
- Yeah.

870
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:52,245
I put my reputation on the line
to close Maria.

871
00:34:52,312 --> 00:34:53,446
Look, it's not my fault.

872
00:34:53,514 --> 00:34:55,615
The firm instituted
a hiring freeze.

873
00:34:55,682 --> 00:34:56,682
If there's
a hiring freeze going on,

874
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,217
then why do I know
for a fact

875
00:34:58,285 --> 00:35:02,421
that Harvey Specter hired
a fifth-year associate today?

876
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:04,056
You offered Katrina Bennett
a job?

877
00:35:04,124 --> 00:35:05,324
I looked into her.

878
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:06,392
Turns out
she's a stellar candidate.

879
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,228
[Scoffs]
You bribed her.

880
00:35:09,296 --> 00:35:11,430
A bribe requires
a clear exchange

881
00:35:11,498 --> 00:35:12,932
of something
for something else.

882
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,600
That didn't happen here.
Bullshit.

883
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:15,601
She said she'd put
the deal through

884
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:17,370
if you offered her a job.

885
00:35:17,437 --> 00:35:18,371
She said she'd put
the deal through,

886
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:19,772
<i>then</i> I offered her a job.

887
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,207
Oh, right, because you needed
an insurance policy.

888
00:35:21,275 --> 00:35:24,510
Because I could see exactly
what you were gonna do.

889
00:35:24,578 --> 00:35:26,946
So you offered her a job to
get her to do what you wanted.

890
00:35:27,014 --> 00:35:28,414
That's something
for something else.

891
00:35:28,415 --> 00:35:30,016
You bribed her.

892
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,551
You bet your ass I did.

893
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:33,519
But what you're too stupid
to understand is

894
00:35:33,587 --> 00:35:35,187
I did it to save you.

895
00:35:35,255 --> 00:35:37,490
Get it
through your goddamn head.

896
00:35:37,558 --> 00:35:39,125
You're not like
other lawyers.

897
00:35:39,192 --> 00:35:40,793
You break
attorney-client privilege,

898
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:42,528
nothing different happens
with Liam,

899
00:35:42,596 --> 00:35:44,797
but they're sure as shit
gonna look into you.

900
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:46,265
And you and I both know what
they're gonna find when they do.

901
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,053
What difference does it make
what they find?

902
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:49,302
There's such a thing
as right and wrong.

903
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:50,436
And we're wrong!

904
00:35:50,504 --> 00:35:51,771
You know what?

905
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:53,306
I have had it up to here
with you blaming me

906
00:35:53,373 --> 00:35:55,441
for every hard choice
that comes with this job.

907
00:35:55,509 --> 00:35:59,445
- Harvey, come on.
- Shut up!

908
00:35:59,513 --> 00:36:03,215
Is your life better or worse
than before I hired you?

909
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:04,483
It's both.

910
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:06,385
Well, maybe you should focus
on the better,

911
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:07,853
because the next time
I have the option

912
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:09,755
to cross a line
to save you,

913
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:13,025
I'll send you packing
and not think twice.

914
00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:17,663
Now get your shit together.

915
00:36:57,471 --> 00:37:00,506
[Elevator bell dings]

916
00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:16,589
Is it done?

917
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:18,691
It's done.

918
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:21,494
Thank you.
What's wrong?

919
00:37:21,561 --> 00:37:24,697
What's wrong?
A man is dead.

920
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:26,565
You killed him,
and I have to live with it.

921
00:37:26,633 --> 00:37:29,502
And you think
I don't know that?

922
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:32,004
I get to go back to my life
like nothing happened,

923
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:34,306
but something did happen.

924
00:37:34,374 --> 00:37:36,542
It makes me sick.
It should.

925
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,145
Is that why you came here,
to make me feel worse?

926
00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:41,881
You've been given a gift
that you don't deserve.

927
00:37:41,948 --> 00:37:43,582
So you better
clean yourself up

928
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,120
and figure out a way
to make up for Albert Chung.

929
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:50,589
[Knock at door]

930
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:55,795
You brought flowers.
You're learning.

931
00:37:55,862 --> 00:37:58,297
They're for Olivia.

932
00:37:58,365 --> 00:38:01,133
What about me?

933
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,334
That's for you.

934
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:04,470
You bought me a...car?

935
00:38:04,538 --> 00:38:06,505
Yeah, I was thinking
we'd drive up to the Berkshires.

936
00:38:06,573 --> 00:38:08,774
There's a little cabin
I know.

937
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:10,309
It's got its own sauna,

938
00:38:10,377 --> 00:38:13,846
private chef.

939
00:38:13,914 --> 00:38:15,114
Oh, wow.

940
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:18,617
I can't go away
with you, Harvey.

941
00:38:18,685 --> 00:38:20,193
Why not?

942
00:38:24,257 --> 00:38:26,358
My brother's
got cancer.

943
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:29,361
He's--
he's not gonna make it.

944
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:32,498
Oh, my God.

945
00:38:32,566 --> 00:38:33,899
Her dad.

946
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:35,334
I mean, we knew
that it was coming.

947
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:38,504
We just didn't know
it would be this fast.

948
00:38:41,508 --> 00:38:43,776
- Is she here?
- No.

949
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:45,711
But I'm going
to my parents',

950
00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:48,481
and I'm gonna--
I'm gonna take her with me.

951
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:51,517
I'm gonna raise her.

952
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:53,552
Why didn't you tell me?

953
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,721
Because I thought,
you know, when...

954
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:57,150
[Sniffles]
you saw Olivia was here,

955
00:38:57,157 --> 00:38:59,258
that we'd reschedule
or something, you know?

956
00:38:59,326 --> 00:39:01,127
And then...

957
00:39:01,194 --> 00:39:04,063
I saw you with her,
and it...

958
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:06,432
It was...

959
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,135
You wanted
to have a night.

960
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:12,104
Okay, I didn't think
it would lead to that.

961
00:39:15,275 --> 00:39:19,078
But I'm really happy
that it did.

962
00:39:19,146 --> 00:39:21,514
When are you going?

963
00:39:21,581 --> 00:39:24,483
Soon.

I'm sorry.

Hey, I never heard from you.
How did the case go?

968
00:39:44,371 --> 00:39:45,938
I don't want
to talk about it.

969
00:39:46,006 --> 00:39:48,440
That bad, huh?

970
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:50,476
Yeah, that bad.

Well, why don't you
come over here,

972
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:54,513
and I'll make you
feel better?

973
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:57,316
I already started
without you.

- It's so disgusting.
- What got into you?

977
00:40:08,328 --> 00:40:12,131
This whole thing
is disgusting.

with me?

00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:24,910
- Do you love your husband?
- What?

00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:25,945
It's a simple question, Tess,
answer it.

- Uh, I don't know.
- See, I don't even know that.

983
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,653
Because we never even talk
about it.

984
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:35,788
Well, we can talk
about it now.

985
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:37,256
I don't want
to talk about it now!

986
00:40:37,324 --> 00:40:40,759
Tess, there is such a thing
as right and wrong.

00:40:40,827 --> 00:40:42,995
And what we're doing here...

988
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:45,431
It's just wrong, and...

989
00:40:45,498 --> 00:40:47,800
you're married.

990
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:53,038
And I don't want
a part of it anymore.

991
00:40:53,106 --> 00:40:58,344
